# Server Error

## Description

Internal server errors can indicate underlying vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that malicious actors can exploit. Persistent occurrences of such errors can also undermine user trust in the platform's security and stability.


## Remediation

Make sure you also refer to the query we sent to the server to reproduce the issue.
