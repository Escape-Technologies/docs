# GraphQL IDE

## Description

A GraphQL IDE provides an interface for users to interact with the Endpoint, but an IDE can also leave room for potential vulnerabilities.


## Remediation

Disable GraphQL IDE, or restrict it.
Head over to your specific engine documentation to know how to do it.



### GraphQL Specific

<details>
    <summary>Apollo</summary>

GraphQL Playground is deprecated and disabled by default since Apollo v3. If you installed it voluntarily with the corresponding plugin, you should consider disabling it to improve security. If you still use Apollo v2, you can disable GraphQL Playground by either: * Setting the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `production` * Explicitly disabling it:  ```javascript  const server = new ApolloServer({    // ...    playground: false,  });  ```Source: * [Apollo v2 Documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2/testing/graphql-playground/) * [Apollo v3 Documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/testing/build-run-queries/#graphql-playground)

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Yoga</summary>

To secure your GraphQL Yoga server, ensure that the playground is disabled in production environments. You can do this by setting the playground option to false when initializing the server.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Awsappsync</summary>

For AWS AppSync, it's important to manage the API access correctly. Use AWS IAM roles, Cognito User Pools, or API keys to control access and disable any unnecessary default settings that may expose the API.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlgo</summary>

When using graphql-go, ensure that you do not expose the GraphiQL interface in production. This can be done by not including the GraphiQL middleware or by conditionally adding it based on the environment.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

In GraphQL-Ruby, disable GraphiQL in production by not mounting the GraphiQL::Rails::Engine or by using environment checks to conditionally enable it.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Hasura</summary>

For Hasura, ensure that the console is not enabled in production. You can disable it by setting the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE` environment variable to false.
