# Sensitive endpoint bruteforce

## Description

During our security assessment, we identified a vulnerability in the
rate-limiting mechanism of a public mutation endpoint. Multiple requests to
this endpoint were made without triggering any rate-limiting defenses. This
lack of rate limitation exposes the endpoint to brute force attacks, where
an attacker could try numerous combinations of credentials or inputs to
gain unauthorized access or disrupt services. Such vulnerabilities are
critical, especially if the endpoint handles sensitive data or critical
functions.


## Remediation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is crucial to implement an effective
rate limiting mechanism on the mutation endpoint. This should include
limiting the number of requests a user can make within a given time frame,
and escalating restrictions for repeated violations. Consider using tools
like Redis for efficient rate limiting. Additionally, implement alert
mechanisms for unusual traffic patterns or repeated failed attempts, which
can be early indicators of a brute force attack.
