# POST based CSRF

## Description

The canonical content-type for GraphQL queries is JSON (`application/json`). Other content-types should be rejected as they facilitate CSRF attacks (e.g., via form submission).

Note that CSRF is an attack vector that specifically target requests where the browser automatically provides authentication (typically through `Cookie` or `Basic` Authentication).

Especially, if your application is attaching the credentials via an `Authorization` header then the browser can't automatically authenticate the requests, and CSRF isn't possible.


## Remediation

Only allow requests with the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.



### GraphQL Specific

<details>
    <summary>Apollo</summary>

Only allow requests with the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`. With Express.js, the `enforce-content-type` middleware can be used to block unwanted content types.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Yoga</summary>

Ensure that your Yoga server is configured to accept only JSON content types for incoming requests to prevent CSRF attacks.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Awsappsync</summary>

Configure AWS AppSync to reject requests with content types other than `application/json` to mitigate CSRF vulnerabilities.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlgo</summary>

In your Go server, set up middleware to check for `Content-Type: application/json` header and reject other content types.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

For GraphQL-Ruby, ensure that your controllers are configured to process only JSON requests to protect against CSRF.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Hasura</summary>

Configure Hasura GraphQL engine to only allow `application/json` content type for requests to prevent CSRF attacks.
