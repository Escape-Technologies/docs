# Open redirection Forgery

## Description

Open redirection vulnerabilities arise when an application incorporates user-controllable data into the target of a redirection in an unsafe way.
An attacker can construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain. This behavior can be leveraged to facilitate phishing attacks against users of the application.
The ability to use an authentic application URL, targeting the correct domain and with a valid SSL certificate (if SSL is used), lends credibility to the phishing attack.


## Remediation

In many cases, this behavior can be avoided in two ways:
- Remove the redirection function from the application, and replace links to it with direct links to the relevant target URLs.
- Maintain a server-side list of all URLs that are permitted for redirection. Instead of passing the target URL as a parameter to the redirector, pass an index into this list.
