# Directory listing

## Description

A directory listing provides an attacker with the complete index of all the resources located inside of the directory.
The specific risks and consequences vary depending on which files are listed and accessible.


## Remediation

- Configure your web server to prevent directory listings for all paths beneath the web root.
- Place into each directory a default file (such as index.htm) that the web server will display instead of returning a directory listing.
