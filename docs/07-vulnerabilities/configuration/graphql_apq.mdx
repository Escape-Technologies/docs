# Automatic Persisted Queries

## Description

The absence of **Automatic Persisted Queries** can cause backend performance problems at scale.

GraphQL clients send queries to Apollo Servers as HTTP requests, including the GraphQL query string.
Depending on your GraphQL schema, the size of a valid query string might be arbitrarily large. As query strings become larger, increased latency and network usage can noticeably degrade client performance.
A persisted query is a query string cached on the server-side, along with its unique identifier (SHA-256 hash of the query). Clients can send this identifier instead of the full query string, drastically reducing request sizes.

To make a query string persist, your GraphQL server must first receive it from a requesting client. Each unique query string must therefore be sent to the server at least once. Once a client has sent a query string to persist, any other client executing that query can benefit from APQ.


## Remediation

To improve network performance for large query strings, enable APQ if your GraphQL server supports it.



### GraphQL Specific

<details>
    <summary>Apollo</summary>

Enable Automatic Persisted queries.For a complete guide on how to do so, see [Apollo's Automatic Persisted Queries documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/).

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

Add graphql-persisted_queries to your Gemfile `gem 'graphql-persisted_queries'` and add the plugin to your schema class:```rubyclass GraphqlSchema < GraphQL::Schema  use GraphQL::PersistedQueriesend```Pass the `:extensions` argument as part of a context to all calls of `GraphqlSchema#execute`,usually it happens in `GraphqlController`, `GraphqlChannel` and tests:```rubyGraphqlSchema.execute(  params[:query],  variables: ensure_hash(params[:variables]),  context: {    extensions: ensure_hash(params[:extensions])  },  operation_name: params[:operationName])```Source: [https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/graphql-ruby-persisted_queries](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/graphql-ruby-persisted_queries).

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Yoga</summary>

To enable Automatic Persisted Queries in GraphQL Yoga, you can use the `useAutomaticPersistedQueries` plugin from the `@envelop/automatic-persisted-queries` package.First, install the package:```bashnpm install @envelop/automatic-persisted-queries ```Then, add the plugin to your Yoga server configuration:```javascript import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'import { useAutomaticPersistedQueries } from '@envelop/automatic-persisted-queries'const server = createServer({  plugins: [    useAutomaticPersistedQueries(),    // ... other plugins  ],})```This will enable APQ for your GraphQL Yoga server.
