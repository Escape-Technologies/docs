# Proxy Disclosure

## Description

If the proxy server can be detected or fingerprinted then this information will help a potential attacker to determine a list of targets against the application,
potential vulnerabilities on the proxy servers and the presence or absence of any proxy-based components that are able to detect, prevent or mitigate the attack.


## Remediation

- Disable the 'TRACE' method on the proxy servers, as well as the origin web/application server.
- Disable the 'OPTIONS' method on the proxy servers, as well as the origin web/application server, if it is not required for other purposes, such as 'CORS' (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).
- Configure all proxies, application servers, and web servers to prevent disclosure of the technology and version information.



### REST Specific

<details>
    <summary>Asp.net</summary>

To prevent proxy detection in ASP.NET, configure your server to remove or customize headers that reveal information about your proxy or software stack. Use middleware to filter out headers like 'Via', 'X-Powered-By', or 'Server'.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Ruby on rails</summary>

In Ruby on Rails, you can mitigate proxy disclosure by configuring your environment to not leak server information. Remove or alter headers that can give away your proxy details.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Next.js</summary>

For Next.js applications, ensure that your server configuration does not expose headers that can be used to identify the proxy. Customize the server response to omit sensitive headers.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Laravel</summary>

In Laravel, use middleware to strip out headers that disclose information about the proxy server. This can help obscure the details of the underlying infrastructure.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Express.js</summary>

With Express.js, use middleware to remove headers that could reveal the presence of a proxy server. This helps to minimize the information an attacker can gather.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Django</summary>

For Django applications, adjust the settings to prevent the server from sending headers that could disclose proxy information. Use middleware to remove or alter these headers.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Symfony</summary>

In Symfony, configure your application to not send headers that could reveal information about the proxy server. Use event listeners to modify the response headers.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Spring boot</summary>

For Spring Boot applications, customize the server properties to avoid sending headers that could identify the proxy server. Use filters to control the headers being sent.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Flask</summary>

In Flask, use the after_request decorator to modify the response and remove headers that could give away proxy server information.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Nuxt</summary>

For Nuxt.js applications, configure your server middleware to remove headers that could disclose the use of a proxy server, thus reducing the attack surface.
