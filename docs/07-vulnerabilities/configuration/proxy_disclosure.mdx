# Proxy Disclosure

## Description

If the proxy server can be detected or fingerprinted then this information will help a potential attacker to determine a list of targets against the application,
potential vulnerabilities on the proxy servers and the presence or absence of any proxy-based components that are able to detect, prevent or mitigate the attack.


## Remediation

- Disable the 'TRACE' method on the proxy servers, as well as the origin web/application server.
- Disable the 'OPTIONS' method on the proxy servers, as well as the origin web/application server, if it is not required for other purposes, such as 'CORS' (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).
- Configure all proxies, application servers, and web servers to prevent disclosure of the technology and version information.



## Configuration

> Identifier: `configuration/proxy_disclosure`
