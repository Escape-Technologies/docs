# Content-Type header

## Description

The `Content-Type` header was either missing or empty.


## Remediation

Ensure your server sets the specific and appropriate `Content-Type` value for the delivered content.



### GraphQL Specific

    <summary>Apollo</summary>

When using Apollo with Express.js, [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) can take care of the security headers.```javascriptconst helmet = require("helmet");...app.use(helmet);```

* Add security headers with the API GatewayPut your AppSync API behind an API Gateway and configure it to act as a proxy to your AppSync endpoint (e.g., using the HTTP Proxy feature).[API Gateway Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html) Then you can manually add headers to each resource. (There is only one resource if your API Gateway is only used to proxy a single AppSync endpoint)Here is an example of security headers you can add :```Cache-Control: no-store Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000 X-Content-Type-Options: nosniffX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGINX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block```* Add security headers using only AWS AppSync AWS AppSync currently does not allow to append custom headers to every response. However, custom response headers can be configured individually for every resolver by using response mapping templates.To do this, go to:   - AppSync > {Your App} > SchemaFor every attached resolver :   - Go to the resolver configuration   - In the "Configure the response mapping template" section, add this :```php$util.http.addResponseHeader("Cache-Control", "no-store")$util.http.addResponseHeader("Content-Security-Policy" , "default-src 'self'")$util.http.addResponseHeader("Strict-Transport-Security", "max-age=63072000")$util.http.addResponseHeader("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff")$util.http.addResponseHeader("X-Frame-Options", "SAMEORIGIN")$util.http.addResponseHeader("X-XSS-Protection", "1; mode=block") ```You can safely ignore this warning if you did this for every single resolver.However, it may still appear here as GraphQL requests like `query { __typename }` are not associated with a resolver; therefore, you cannot add custom response headers. (Which doesn't matter as such requests cannot leak data as no actual field is queried)[AWS AppSync adds support for custom response headers](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/02/aws-appsync-support-custom-response-headers/) [HTTP helpers in $util.http](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/http-helpers-in-utils-http.html) [Resolver Mapping Template Programming Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-mapping-template-reference-programming-guide.html)

    <summary>Graphqlgo</summary>

You can use a HTTP middleware to add security headers.For instance, with [srikrsna/security-headers](https://github.com/srikrsna/security-headers): ```goimport (  secure "github.com/srikrsna/security-headers") h := handler.New(&handler.Config{  Schema:   &schema,  ...})s := &secure.Secure{  STSIncludeSubdomains: true,  STSPreload:           true,  STSMaxAgeSeconds:     90,  FrameOption: secure.FrameAllowFrom,  FrameOrigin: "https://example.com/",  ContentTypeNoSniff: true,  XSSFilterBlock: true,  HPKPPins: []string{  "HBkhsug765gdKHhvdj6jdb7jJh/j+soZS7sWs=",  "hjshHSHU68hbdkHhvdkgksgsg+jd/jHJ68HBH=",  },  HPKPMaxAge:            5184000,  HPKPReportURI:         "https://www.example.org/hpkp-report",  HPKPIncludeSubdomains: true,  ExpectCTMaxAge:    5184000,  ExpectCTEnforce:   true,  ExpectCTReportUri: "https://www.example.org/ct-report",  ReferrerPolicy: secure.ReferrerStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin,}http.Handle("/graphql", s.Middleware()(h))http.ListenAndServe(":8082", nil)```

    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

In GraphQL-Ruby, you can set response headers in the context within each resolver or by using a middleware. Here's an example of setting headers in a middleware:

<details>
    <summary>Hasura</summary>

With Hasura, you can set response headers using Actions or Remote Schemas. For Actions, you can define the headers in the handler's response. For Remote Schemas, you can set the headers in your server configuration. Here's an example for an Action handler:

For GraphQL Yoga, you can use middleware to set the `Content-Type` header. Here's an example using Express middleware:
