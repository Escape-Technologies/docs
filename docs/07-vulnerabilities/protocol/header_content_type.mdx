# Content-Type header

The `Content-Type` header was either missing or empty.


## Remediation

Ensure your server sets the specific and appropriate `Content-Type` value for the delivered content.



### GraphQL Specific

    <summary>Apollo</summary>

When using Apollo with Express.js, [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) can take care of the security headers.

```javascript
const helmet = require("helmet");
...
app.use(helmet);
```

* Add security headers with the API Gateway

Put your AppSync API behind an API Gateway and configure it to act as a proxy to your AppSync endpoint (e.g., using the HTTP Proxy feature).

[API Gateway Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html)

Then you can manually add headers to each resource. (There is only one resource if your API Gateway is only used to proxy a single AppSync endpoint)

Here is an example of security headers you can add :

```
Cache-Control: no-store
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```


* Add security headers using only AWS AppSync

AWS AppSync currently does not allow to append custom headers to every response.

However, custom response headers can be configured individually for every resolver by using response mapping templates.

To do this, go to:
   - AppSync > {Your App} > Schema

For every attached resolver :
   - Go to the resolver configuration
   - In the "Configure the response mapping template" section, add this :

```php
$util.http.addResponseHeader("Cache-Control", "no-store")
$util.http.addResponseHeader("Content-Security-Policy", "default-src 'self'")
$util.http.addResponseHeader("Strict-Transport-Security", "max-age=63072000")
$util.http.addResponseHeader("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff")
$util.http.addResponseHeader("X-Frame-Options", "SAMEORIGIN")
$util.http.addResponseHeader("X-XSS-Protection", "1; mode=block")
```

You can safely ignore this warning if you did this for every single resolver.

However, it may still appear here as GraphQL requests like `query { __typename }` are not associated with a resolver; therefore, you cannot add custom response headers. (Which doesn't matter as such requests cannot leak data as no actual field is queried)

You can use a HTTP middleware to add security headers.

For instance, with [srikrsna/security-headers](https://github.com/srikrsna/security-headers):

```go
import (
  secure "github.com/srikrsna/security-headers"
)

h := handler.New(&handler.Config{
  Schema:   &schema,
  ...
})

s := &secure.Secure{
  STSIncludeSubdomains: true,
  STSPreload:           true,
  STSMaxAgeSeconds:     90,

  FrameOption: secure.FrameAllowFrom,
  FrameOrigin: "https://example.com/",

  ContentTypeNoSniff: true,

  XSSFilterBlock: true,

  HPKPPins: []string{
  "HBkhsug765gdKHhvdj6jdb7jJh/j+soZS7sWs=",
  "hjshHSHU68hbdkHhvdkgksgsg+jd/jHJ68HBH=",
  },
  HPKPMaxAge:            5184000,
  HPKPReportURI:         "https://www.example.org/hpkp-report",
  HPKPIncludeSubdomains: true,

  ExpectCTMaxAge:    5184000,
  ExpectCTEnforce:   true,
  ExpectCTReportUri: "https://www.example.org/ct-report",

  ReferrerPolicy: secure.ReferrerStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin,
}
http.Handle("/graphql", s.Middleware()(h))

http.ListenAndServe(":8082", nil)
```
