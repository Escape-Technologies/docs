# Cookie Security

## Description

A cookie has been set without any secure flag, which means that the cookie can be accessed via unencrypted connections or that JavaScript code can access the cookie.
If a malicious script runs on this page, then the cookie will be accessible and can be transmitted to another hacker-controlled site. If this is a session cookie, then session hijacking may be possible.


## Remediation

Whenever a cookie contains sensitive information or is a session token, it should always be passed using an encrypted channel.
Set `HttpOnly`, `SameSite` and `Secure` directives in Set-Cookie header.



### GraphQL Specific

    <summary>Apollo</summary>

When using Apollo with Express.js, [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) can take care of the security headers.```javascriptconst helmet = require("helmet");...app.use(helmet);```

<details>
    <summary>Yoga</summary>

For GraphQL Yoga, you can use middleware to set security headers. Here's an example using Express.js middleware:

    <summary>Awsappsync</summary>

* Add security headers with the API GatewayPut your AppSync API behind an API Gateway and configure it to act as a proxy to your AppSync endpoint (e.g., using the HTTP Proxy feature).[API Gateway Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html) Then you can manually add headers to each resource. (There is only one resource if your API Gateway is only used to proxy a single AppSync endpoint)Here is an example of security headers you can add :```Cache-Control: no-store Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000 X-Content-Type-Options: nosniffX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGINX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block```* Add security headers using only AWS AppSync AWS AppSync currently does not allow to append custom headers to every response. However, custom response headers can be configured individually for every resolver by using response mapping templates.To do this, go to:   - AppSync > {Your App} > SchemaFor every attached resolver :   - Go to the resolver configuration   - In the "Configure the response mapping template" section, add this :```php$util.http.addResponseHeader("Cache-Control", "no-store")$util.http.addResponseHeader("Content-Security-Policy" , "default-src 'self'")$util.http.addResponseHeader("Strict-Transport-Security", "max-age=63072000")$util.http.addResponseHeader("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff")$util.http.addResponseHeader("X-Frame-Options", "SAMEORIGIN")$util.http.addResponseHeader("X-XSS-Protection", "1; mode=block") ```You can safely ignore this warning if you did this for every single resolver.However, it may still appear here as GraphQL requests like `query { __typename }` are not associated with a resolver; therefore, you cannot add custom response headers. (Which doesn't matter as such requests cannot leak data as no actual field is queried)[AWS AppSync adds support for custom response headers](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/02/aws-appsync-support-custom-response-headers/) [HTTP helpers in $util.http](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/http-helpers-in-utils-http.html) [Resolver Mapping Template Programming Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-mapping-template-reference-programming-guide.html)

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlgo</summary>

You can use a HTTP middleware to add security headers.For instance, with [srikrsna/security-headers](https://github.com/srikrsna/security-headers):

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

In Ruby on Rails with GraphQL-Ruby, you can use the `secure_headers` gem to set security headers. Add the gem to your Gemfile and configure it:

<details>
    <summary>Hasura</summary>

For Hasura GraphQL engine, you can set security headers using a reverse proxy like Nginx or using Hasura's environment variables to configure the headers:
