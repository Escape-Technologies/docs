# HeartBleed

## Description

The TLS implementation in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g does not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, potentially disclosing sensitive information.


## Remediation

To effectively prevent HeartBleed attacks:
- Update to OpenSSL 1.0.1g or later.
- Re-issue HTTPS certificates.
- Change asymmetric private keys and shared secret keys, since these may have been compromised with no evidence of corruption in the server log files.



### GraphQL Specific

<details>
    <summary>Apollo</summary>

Ensure that your Apollo server is not using the vulnerable version of OpenSSL. Upgrade OpenSSL to version 1.0.1g or later.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Yoga</summary>

Update the Yoga server to use a version of OpenSSL that is not affected by the Heartbleed vulnerability. This typically means upgrading to OpenSSL 1.0.1g or above.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Awsappsync</summary>

AWS AppSync is managed by AWS and any underlying SSL/TLS vulnerabilities would be addressed by AWS. Ensure that you are using the latest updates provided by AWS.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlgo</summary>

For GraphQL servers using GraphQL-Go, make sure to update the OpenSSL library to a non-vulnerable version, such as 1.0.1g or later.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

If you are using GraphQL-Ruby, ensure that the server hosting the application is not using the vulnerable OpenSSL version. Upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.1g or newer.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Hasura</summary>

For Hasura GraphQL engine, ensure that the underlying system's OpenSSL is updated to version 1.0.1g or above to mitigate the Heartbleed vulnerability.
