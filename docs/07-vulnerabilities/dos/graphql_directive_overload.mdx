title: Directive overloading

# Directive overloading

## Description

Directive Overloading occurs when a user can send a query with many consecutive directives and overload the engine handling those directives.


## Remediation

Limit the number of directives allowed in a query.
This should be handled by the GraphQL engine while parsing the document, otherwise this can lead to a heap overflow.
