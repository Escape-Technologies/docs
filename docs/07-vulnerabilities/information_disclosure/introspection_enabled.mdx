# Introspection enabled

## Description

GraphQL introspection enables you to query a GraphQL server for information about the underlying schema, including data like types, fields, queries, mutations, and even the field-level descriptions.
It discloses sensitive information that potentially allows an attacker to design malicious operations.


## Remediation

Introspection should primarily be used as a discovery and diagnostic tool when we're in the **development phase** of building out GraphQL APIs.
While it's still possible for bad actors to learn how to write malicious queries by reverse engineering your GraphQL API through a lot of trial and error, **disabling introspection** is a form of security by obscurity.



### GraphQL Specific

    <summary>Apollo</summary>

To disable Introspection, either set `NODE_ENV` to `production` or enforce it : ```javascript const server = new ApolloServer({   typeDefs,   resolvers,   introspection: false }); ``` Source: <https://escape.tech/blog/9-graphql-security-best-practices/>

<details>
    <summary>Awsappsync</summary>

Add ACL rule to prevent GraphQL __schema introspection queries to the API.This is achieved by blocking any HTTP body that includes the string "__schema".This would be entered into the Rule JSON editor when creating a web ACL in the AWS WAF Console.For more information refer to :[AWS AppSync - Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/what-is-appsync.html) [Integrate an AppSync API with AWS WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/WAF-Integration.html) [AWS Web Application Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html)

You can disable introspection with a custom middleware filtering the keyword `__schema`:

    <summary>Hasura</summary>

Hasura allows you to control who can run an introspection query. To do so: - Go to Project Console > Security Settings > Schema Introspection - Select a role (e.g., guest) - Check "Disabled"See the [official guide](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/cloud/security/disable-graphql-introspection/) for more information.

    <summary>Yoga</summary>

To disable introspection in Yoga, you can set the `introspection` option to `false` when creating the server instance.
