# Field suggestion

## Description

If introspection is disabled on your target, **Field Suggestion** still allow users infer the entire schema, with a tool like [Clairvoyance](https://github.com/nikitastupin/clairvoyance).

If you query a field with a typo, GraphQL will attempt to suggest fields close to what was requested. Example:
```
  Error: Cannot query field "createSesion" on type "RootMutation". Did you mean "createSession", "createUser", "createFile", or "createImage"?
```


## Remediation

Disable Field Suggestion in production.
