# Data leak

## Description

The API exposes sensitive data to the public, such as secrets, private keys, tokens, passwords, etc.
This security check detects this sensitive data.

## Remediation

- If there is a chance that unauthorized individuals have already accessed the secret, revoke it immediately and notify the concerned team.

- If the leak happens through another vulnerability, such as a [Server-Side Request Forgery](/vulnerabilities/request_forgery/ssrf), fix this issue to avoid further secret leaks.

- Have your developers implement these best practices to avoid leaking secrets:
  -Inside logs: [Keeping Sensitive Data Out of Logs](https://medium.com/@joecrobak/seven-best-practices-for-keeping-sensitive-data-out-of-logs-3d7bbd12904).
  -Inside commits: [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) or [Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks).
  -In the configuration, using an environment variable manager like [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault).

See [Apollo's Access Control Documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/security/authentication/#in-resolvers).
For large scale applications, you'll want to use a specific package like [GraphQL Shield](https://github.com/maticzav/graphql-shield) for quick and easy Access Control management.
