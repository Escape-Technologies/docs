# Private IP

## Description

A private IP (such as 10.x.x.x, 172.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x) or an Amazon EC2 private hostname... has been found in the HTTP response body.
This information might be helpful for further attacks targeting internal systems.


## Remediation

* Remove the private IP address from the HTTP response body.
* For comments, use JSP/ASP/PHP comment instead of HTML/JavaScript comment which can be seen by client browsers.



## Configuration

> Identifier: `information_disclosure/private_ip`
