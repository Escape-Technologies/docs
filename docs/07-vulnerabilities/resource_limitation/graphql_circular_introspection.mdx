# Circular introspection

## Description

A circular introspection has been performed on the system.
This can be exploited to conduct a Denial of Service attack.

The GraphQL introspection is done recursively on your schema.
By calling several objects that reference each other, an attacker can create a circular reference.

```graphql
__schema {
  types {
    fields {
      type {
        fields {
          type ... and so on infinitely
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Creating a circular reference will increase the size of the returned document exponentially.
The larger your schema is, the bigger the document will be.

This DOS attack is hard to exploit as the size of the query might be limited by a server before reaching your backend.


## Remediation

To prevent circular introspection from being abused:
- Limit the maximum depth of the introspection query.
- Limit the maximum elapsed time to execute a GraphQL query.
- Disable your introspection.



### GraphQL Specific

<details>
    <summary>Apollo</summary>

To prevent circular introspection in Apollo Server, you can use query complexity analysis to set a maximum depth for queries. This will limit the depth of introspection queries and prevent the possibility of a circular reference causing a Denial of Service attack.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Yoga</summary>

In GraphQL Yoga, to mitigate circular introspection, you can implement depth limiting by using a custom validation rule that checks the depth of the queries and restricts them to a certain threshold.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Awsappsync</summary>

AWS AppSync provides built-in security features to prevent complex queries, including circular introspection. You can set query depth and complexity limits in the AWS AppSync console or through the AWS CLI.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlgo</summary>

For GraphQL servers using Go, you can prevent circular introspection by implementing a query depth limit using middleware that checks the depth of incoming queries.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

In GraphQL-Ruby, you can prevent circular introspection by using the max_depth query analyzer to limit the depth of accepted queries.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Hasura</summary>

Hasura allows you to set depth limits for queries in the console or through environment variables, which can help prevent circular introspection attacks.
