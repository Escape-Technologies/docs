# Cyclic query

## Description

GraphQL allows developers to nest queries and objects. Attackers can abuse this feature by calling a deeply nested query similar to a recursive function and causing a Denial of Service by exhausting CPU, memory, or other resources.


## Remediation

Although the ability to fetch a cyclic query is necessary for some GraphQL application, it is best to always implement security measures to control these cyclic queries:
  - **Set query timeouts**: restrict the time a query is allowed to run.
  - **Set a maximum query depth**: limit the tolerated depth of queries in order to prevent overly deep queries from abusing resources.
  - **Set a maximum query complexity**: limit the complexity of queries to mitigate the abuse of GraphQL resources.
  - **Use server-time-based throttling**: limit the amount of server time a user can consume.
  - **Use query-complexity-based throttling**: limit the total complexity of queries a user can consume.

Although the ability to fetch a cyclic query is necessary for some GraphQL application, it is best to always implement security measures to control these cyclic queries:-**Set a maximum query depth**: limit the depth of allowed queries in order to prevent overly deep queries from abusing GraphQL resources.  You can easily limit query depth with the very light [graphql-depth-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-depth-limit) library.Add a maximum query depth limit based on your knowledge of the schema and how deep you believe a legitimate query could go.  ```javascript  import depthLimit from 'graphql-depth-limit'  const server = new ApolloServer({    ...    validationRules: [depthLimit(5)]    });  ```  Source: <https://escape.tech/blog/9-graphql-security-best-practices/>.-**Set maximum query complexity**: limit the complexity of allowed queries to prevent overly complex queries from abusing GraphQL resources.  To do so, add a module to compute the complexity of each query and set a threshold on this complexity so that overly broad requests get canceled.    For a user-friendly module which requires no schema modification whatsoever, check out the [graphql-validation-complexity](https://github.com/4Catalyzer/graphql-validation-complexity) module.    ```javascript    import { createComplexityLimitRule } from 'graphql-validation-complexity';    const ComplexityLimitRule = createComplexityLimitRule(1000);const apolloServer = new ApolloServer({        ...        validationRules: [ComplexityLimitRule],    });    ```    For a more customizable module that lets you manually configure the cost of each field/type of your schema, take a look at the [graphql-cost-analysis](https://github.com/pa-bru/graphql-cost-analysis) module.    This second option is best suited for a more realistic complexity estimator as all fields may not be equal in terms of complexity.

    <summary>Graphqlgo</summary>

For GraphQL servers using Go, you can use the `graphql-go` library with a custom query complexity analysis middleware to limit the depth and complexity of queries.

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

In GraphQL-Ruby, you can define a custom analysis engine to limit query depth and complexity.
