# Response size

A very large response was detected.


## Remediation

A response this large may be a forerunner sign of a DoS attack: your
API should provide pagination or a similar way to limit the size of the response.



## Configuration

> Identifier: `resource_limitation/response_size`



### Examples



#### Ignore this check

```json
{
    "checks": {
        "resource_limitation/response_size": {
            "skip": true
        }
    }
}
```
