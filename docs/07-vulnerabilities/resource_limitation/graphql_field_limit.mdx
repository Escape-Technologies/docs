# Field limit

## Description

Attackers may craft complex queries by requesting a significant number of fields.

This could lead to potential *DoS attacks* or *information leakage*.


## Remediation

Limit query complexity by using a library specific to your engine.



### GraphQL Specific

<details>
    <summary>Apollo</summary>

Add a module to compute query complexity and set a threshold so that overly broad requests get canceled.For a user-friendly module which requires no schema modification whatsoever, check out the [graphql-validation-complexity](https://github.com/4Catalyzer/graphql-validation-complexity) module.```javascriptimport { createComplexityLimitRule } from 'graphql-validation-complexity'; const ComplexityLimitRule = createComplexityLimitRule(1000);const apolloServer = new ApolloServer({    ...    validationRules: [ComplexityLimitRule], });```For a more customizable module that lets you manually configure the cost of each field/type of your schema, take a look at the [graphql-cost-analysis](https://github.com/pa-bru/graphql-cost-analysis) module.This second option is best suited for a more realistic complexity estimator as all fields may not be equal in terms of complexity.To learn more about complexity estimation, you can read: [Securing Your GraphQL API from Malicious Queries](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/graphql/security/securing-your-graphql-api-from-malicious-queries/).

<details>
    <summary>Yoga</summary>

In GraphQL Yoga, you can use the `graphql-query-complexity` library to prevent complex queries from overloading your server. Define complexity scores for your types and fields and set a maximum allowed complexity for queries.

<details>
    <summary>Awsappsync</summary>

For AWS AppSync, you can use the built-in features to limit the depth and complexity of GraphQL operations to mitigate against costly queries and potential DoS attacks.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlgo</summary>

Implement a complexity limiting strategy in your Go server by using a library like `graphql-go/graphql` with a complexity limit extension.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

In GraphQL-Ruby, use the query complexity analysis feature to protect against complex queries by setting a maximum query complexity.

<details>
    <summary>Hasura</summary>

Limit the number of fetched fields with Response Limiting.To learn how to implement it, check out [Hasura's Response Limiting guide](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura-advanced/security/5-response-limit/).

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlphp</summary>

```phpuse GraphQL\GraphQL;use GraphQL\Validator\Rules\ QueryComplexity;use GraphQL\Validator\DocumentValidator;$rule = new QueryComplexity($maxQueryComplexity = 100);DocumentValidator::addRule($rule); GraphQL::executeQuery(/*...*/);```Source: <https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php/blob/master/docs/security.md#query-complexity-analysis>

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphene</summary>

With `graphene-django`, it is possible to implement a custom GraphQL backend to limit query complexity, such as this one:[graphene-django query cost analysis / complexity limits](https://gist.github.com/thibaudlabat/7b86f1a4da34eccfbfa524ca7359e87c).

## Configuration

> Identifier: `resource_limitation/graphql_field_limit`

### Options

- **threshold** : Maximum fields before raising an alert (-1 = infinite).
  



### Examples



#### Ignore this check

```json
{
    "checks": {
        "resource_limitation/graphql_field_limit": {
            "skip": true
        }
    }
}
```
