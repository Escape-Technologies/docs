# Unreachable server

## Description

The server went offline for too long. This can be caused by a server crash, a network issue, or a misconfiguration.
Often, this is a sign of a bigger issue.


## Remediation

We recommend you to investigate two possible causes:
- Unhandled exceptions in your code: Verify that your code is handling exceptions properly. - Uncontrolled resource consumption: Verify what resolver has been used to leverage the data source.
