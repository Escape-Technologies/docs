# Alias limit

## Description

GraphQL supports the aliasing of multiple sub-queries into a single query. It allows requesting multiple instances of objects efficiently and without conflicts.
However, attackers can leverage this feature to bypass many security measures, including rate limiting.

Query example:
```
query {
  a: myself{username},
  b: myself{username},
  ...
  }
```

Response example:
```javascript
{
  "data":
  {
    "a": {"username":"EscapeAdmin"},
    "b": {"username":"EscapeAdmin"},
    ...
  }
}
```


## Remediation

**Limit query aliasing** in your GraphQL Engine to prevent aliasing-based attacks.



### GraphQL Specific

<details>
    <summary>Apollo</summary>

Install our open source package [GraphQL Armor](https://escape.tech/graphql-armor/docs/getting-started) for Apollo.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Yoga</summary>

To prevent abuse of query aliasing in Yoga, you can use GraphQL middleware to analyze and limit the complexity of incoming queries. Implementing a query depth limit can also help mitigate this issue.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Awsappsync</summary>

For AWS AppSync, you can use AWS WAF to create rules that limit the complexity and depth of GraphQL queries to prevent abuse through excessive aliasing.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

In GraphQL-Ruby, you can use the query complexity analysis feature to set limits on query complexity and depth, which can help prevent abuse through aliasing.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Hasura</summary>

Hasura provides built-in mechanisms to limit query complexity and depth. Use the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_MAX_QUERY_DEPTH` and `HASURA_GRAPHQL_MAX_COMPLEXITY` environment variables to configure these limits and prevent aliasing abuse.

## Configuration

> Identifier: `resource_limitation/graphql_alias_limit`

### Options

- **threshold** : Maximum aliases before raising an alert (-1 = infinite).
  



### Examples



#### Ignore this check

```json
{
    "checks": {
        "resource_limitation/graphql_alias_limit": {
            "skip": true
        }
    }
}
```
