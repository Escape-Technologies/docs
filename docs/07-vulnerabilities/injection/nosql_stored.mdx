# NoSQL Injection Stored

## Description

A NoSQL injection vulnerability occurs when users can insert (or “inject”) malicious NoSQL code in a legit SQL query that is built from user-submitted input.
A successful NoSQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data, execute administration operations on the database (such as shutting down the DBMS), recover the content of a given file from the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system.


## Remediation

Primary defenses:
- Use a sanitization library.
- Cast the inputs to the expected type (eg: The username and password are strings so cast the variables to a string).
- Never use `where`, `mapReduce`, or `group` operators with user input: they allow the attacker to inject JavaScript and are therefore much more dangerous than others. For extra safety, set `javascriptEnabled` to false in mongod.conf (if using mongoDB).
- Enforce Least Privilege.



### GraphQL Specific

<details>
    <summary>Apollo</summary>

To prevent NoSQL injection in Apollo, validate and sanitize all user inputs. Use parameterized queries or the Apollo built-in features to handle user input safely.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Yoga</summary>

In Yoga, ensure that all inputs are properly validated and sanitized. Avoid directly passing user input to database queries.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Awsappsync</summary>

For AWS AppSync, use VTL (Velocity Template Language) to sanitize and validate input arguments before they are passed to resolvers.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlgo</summary>

In GraphQL-Go, use middleware to validate and sanitize input data before it reaches the resolver functions.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

For GraphQL-Ruby, use built-in validators or custom validation methods to ensure that all inputs are properly sanitized before executing queries.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Hasura</summary>

With Hasura, leverage permission rules and session variables to control access and validate inputs at the GraphQL layer.
