# NoSQL Injection Stored

## Description

A NoSQL injection vulnerability occurs when users can insert (or “inject”) malicious NoSQL code in a legit SQL query that is built from user-submitted input.
A successful NoSQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data, execute administration operations on the database (such as shutting down the DBMS), recover the content of a given file from the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system.


## Remediation

Primary defenses:
- Use a sanitization library.
- Cast the inputs to the expected type (eg: The username and password are strings so cast the variables to a string).
- Never use `where`, `mapReduce`, or `group` operators with user input: they allow the attacker to inject JavaScript and are therefore much more dangerous than others. For extra safety, set `javascriptEnabled` to false in mongod.conf (if using mongoDB).
- Enforce Least Privilege.



## Configuration

    }
}
```
