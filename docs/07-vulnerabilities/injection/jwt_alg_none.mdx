title: JWT no algorithm

# JWT no algorithm

## Description

We sent a token with the 'none' algorithm and it was accepted by the server.
This means that we can handcraft any token to impersonate another user.


## Remediation

You must validate the algorithm used to sign the token before checking it's signature.



## Configuration

> Identifier: `injection/jwt_alg_none`



### Examples



#### Ignore this check

```json
{
    "checks": {
        "injection/jwt_alg_none": {
            "skip": true
        }
    }
}
```
