# JWT Signature check

## Description

We sent a token with an invalid signature and it was accepted by the server.


## Remediation

You must validate the token signature before thrusting the token content.



### REST Specific

<details>
    <summary>Asp.net</summary>

Ensure that the JWT token signature is validated against a strong secret key or public key. Use middleware to enforce signature checks on every request.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Ruby on rails</summary>

Use a library like 'jwt' to decode and verify the JWT signature. Ensure that the secret key is not hardcoded and is securely managed.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Next.js</summary>

Implement signature verification in your API routes or use a middleware that checks the JWT signature before processing the request.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Laravel</summary>

Use Laravel's built-in JWT authentication guard to validate the token signature. Configure it properly in the auth.php config file.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Express.js</summary>

Use a JWT middleware like 'express-jwt' to validate the token signature on each request. Configure it with the correct secret or key.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Django</summary>

Use Django's authentication system to verify JWT tokens. A package like 'djangorestframework-jwt' can be used for this purpose.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Symfony</summary>

Use the 'lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle' to handle JWT tokens. Ensure the signature is verified with each request.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Spring boot</summary>

Use Spring Security with a JWT library to enforce signature validation. Configure it to use the correct signing key.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Flask</summary>

Use Flask-JWT-Extended to handle JWT operations. Ensure that the token signature is validated on each protected endpoint.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Nuxt</summary>

Validate the JWT in your Nuxt application by using a middleware that checks the token signature before rendering the page or API call.

</details>
