# CRLF Injection

## Description

CRLF occurs when an attacker can abuse the carriage return character (\r) and a newline character (\n) in an HTTP request in order to inject new headers or a new body for the HTTP request.
This attack is a very dangerous attack as it can give the attacker the ability to create whatever request he wants.


## Remediation

The only way to prevent CRLF attacks is to carefully sanitize every message that is sent by the client.
