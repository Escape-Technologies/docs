title: JWT algorithm confusion

# JWT algorithm confusion

## Description

We sent a token with an invalid algorithm and it was accepted by the server.
In this case, HS256 (HMAC with SHA-256) is a symmetric algorithm, which means that the same key is used to sign and verify the token.


## Remediation

You must enforce the algorithm used to sign the token.



## Configuration

> Identifier: `injection/jwt_alg_confusion`
