# Custom Payload Injection ðŸ’‰

Escape provides users with the capability to inject custom payloads in its security scanner to ensure precision and thoroughness in testing. There are two main methods for this:

1. **Custom Security Tests**
2. **Hotstart Parameter**
3. **Defining Custom Scalars (Data Types)**

These customization methods improve scan quality by tailoring tests specifically to an application's needs. Let's dive into the details.

## Method 1 - Using custom security tests

<BetaBadge />

We provide a tool that allows you to send custom requests to any URLs within your organization. This utility is particularly useful for running static security assessments on your web applications, identifying regression bugs, or investigating specialized in-house security concerns.

### Configuring a Static Security Assessment

To initiate a new static security assessment, navigate to the Expert tab in your application settings.

Below is a sample configuration that illustrates a static security assessment aimed at sending a GraphQL query to a specified endpoint. The assessment will then validate if the server's response status is 200.

```json
{
  "custom_checks": [
    {
      "name": "Example-1",
      "severity": "high",
      "http": [
        {
          "user": "public",
          "raw": "@Host: https://[REDACTED]\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: [REDACTED]\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: 194\n\n{\"query\":\"query {\n    debug(test: \\\"y\\\") {\n        id\n        username\n        credit_card {\n            belong_to {\n                id\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\",\"variables\":{}}",
          "matchers": [
            {
              "status": [200],
              "part": "status"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "params": {
}
```

To easily encode your raw request located in a req.txt file, execute the following Python command:

```python
cat req.txt | python -c "import sys; print(''.join(sys.stdin).replace('\n', '\\\\n').replace('\\\\\"', '\\\\\\\\\"').replace('\"', '\\\\\"'))"
```

### API

The api is fairly inspired by the [Nuclei template engine](https://docs.nuclei.sh/template-guide/introduction).

:::note JSON Schema example

```
{
    "custom_checks": {
        "name": "**value**",                                                            # The name of the check
        "severity": "high | medium | low | info",                                       # The severity of the alert found
        "http": {
            "raw": "**value**",                                                         # The raw request to send
            "user": "**value**",                                                        # The user to use for the request
            "matchers": {
                "part": "status | body | headers | headers_keys | headers_values",      # The part of the response to match
                "regex": ["**value**", ...],                                            # Regexes to use for the match
                "status": ["**value**", ...],                                           # Statuses to match
                "words": ["**value**", ...],                                            # Words to match
            }
        }
    }
}
```

:::

#### Matchers

You can attempt to match a specific part of the response using the `part` parameter. The following parts are available:

- `status`: The status code of the response
- `body`: The body of the response
- `headers`: The headers (key and values) of the response
- `headers_keys`: The keys of the headers of the response
- `headers_values`: The values of the headers of the response

You can use the following parameters to match the response:

- `regex`: A list of regexes to match
- `status`: A list of status codes to match
- `words`: A list of words to match

If one of the matchers is successful, an alert will be raised, based on the severity of the check.

#### Special Commands

Special commands should be placed at the beginning of the RAW request body.

- @Host: Allows you to manually set the host for the request. Useful for forcing an HTTPS connection.
- @timeout: Allows you to manually set the timeout duration for the request. The default timeout is 5 seconds.

## Method 2 - Using the Hotstart feature

The `hotstart` parameter allows users to provide specific GraphQL query strings. This not only gives Escape more insight into the application's business logic but also aids in faster and more accurate scanning.

**Example**:

```json
{
  "hotstart": [
    "query { child(parentId: \"b63f4020-45f6-4f33-9747-32ac8f270097\" ) { id name birthdate }}",
    "query { bank(account: 1337) { id address }}"
  ]
}
```

## Method 3 - Defining Custom Data Types (Scalars)

Escape operates on a [comprehensive scalar architecture](/advanced-usage/data-types-reference), granting users the power to define their own data types or override existing ones via the `escaperc`

### Structure for custom scalars:

```json
{
  "scalars": {
    "custom_scalar_identifier": {
      "description": "value",
      "examples": ["value"],
      "names": ["value"],
      "parents": ["ID", "Int", "String", "Boolean", "Float"],
      "patterns": ["value"],
      "sensitivity": 0
    }
  }
}
```

### Fields

- `description`: Brief description for the scalar.
- `examples`: Sample values for the scalar (used in the explore phase as default values). Be cautious: the scanner will ignore the checks for these values.
- `names`: Possible names for the scalar.
- `parents`: GraphQL's default type the scalar is compatible with.
- `patterns`: Potential regex-friendly values for the scalar (utilized for the checks).
- `sensitivity`: Data sensitivity level. Allowed values are `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. Values `2` and `3` will serve to raise sensitive data alerts in Escape.

### Example

This is how JWT is defined by default in Escape's engine:

```json
jwt:
  description: JSON Web Token
  examples:
    - eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
  names:
    - jwt
    - Token
    - Authorization
    - Authorisation
    - Bearer
  parents:
    - String
  patterns:
    - eyJ(?:[a-zA-Z0-9_=]+)\.eyJ(?:[a-zA-Z0-9_=]+)\.(?:[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\+\/=]*)
    - (?i)\b(ey[0-9a-z]{30,34}\.ey[0-9a-z-\/_]{30,500}\.[0-9a-zA-Z-\/_]{10,200}={0,2})(?:['|\"|\n|\r|\s|\x60|;]|$)
  sensitivity: 3
```

# Modifying current attacks

Every security checks comes with various parameters that can be used to customize their default behaviours. All those parameters are detailed in the `Vulnerabilities Reference` section.
