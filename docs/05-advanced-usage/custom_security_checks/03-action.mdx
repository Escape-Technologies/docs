# Action

Once you have selected a request-response pair with your Matcher block, you can start fuzzing !

You can leverage the powerful features of Escape's technology to fuzz in a technology-agnostic manner, but with full knowledge of the data types underneath (aka scalar).

## Fuzzing techniques

### Scalar replace
Detect specific scalar data types in the request that the scanner will send, and replace according to your regex groups.

```yaml
fuzz:
  - scalar_replace:
      kind: 'EMAIL'
      regex: '(.*)@escape.tech'
      replace: '$1@gmail.com'
```


### Scalar Sniper
Detect specific scalar types in the request, and generate several requests using a payload list.

```yaml
- scalar_sniper:
    kind: 'USERNAME'
    values:
      - 'userX'
      - 'userY'
      - 'userZ'
```

### JQ raw editing
Only for JSON-based payloads, you can directly edit the data structure using JQ, and it will be injected into the fuzzed request.

```yaml
- jq:
    script: '. | {"user": .user, "phone": 123}'
```
