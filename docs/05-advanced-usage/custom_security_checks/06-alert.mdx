# Alert

Once you have selected a request-response pair with your Matcher block, you can start fuzzing !

You can leverage the powerful features of Escape's technology to fuzz in a technology-agnostic manner, but with full knowledge of the data types underneath (aka scalar).

The `alert` section is triggered if all conditions of the detection block resolve to true.

- **Alert Details (`name`, `title_on_pass`, `title_on_fail`, `context`, `description`, `remediation`, `severity`):**
  - Examples: Name, titles, context, description, remediation steps, and severity.

This documentation provides an overview of the custom security check file format, explaining each block and its purpose. Adjust the checks based on your application's specific security requirements and potential vulnerabilities.
```

Feel free to customize the documentation further to suit your needs!
