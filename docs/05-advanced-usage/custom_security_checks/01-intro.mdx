# Custom security tests

Escape enables you to write custom tests with logic blocks and multiple match/fuzz/alert blocks.

This enables specific business logic tests, or broader company policies to be validated against all your APIs, or a subset of them.

## Overview

![Escape Custom Security Checks](./img/sc_diagram.svg)

Here's an overview of how Escape can help you narrow down your target, your fuzzing and your alerting.

In a YAML format, you can define a Security Check that defines one or several Matchers.

These matchers can then contain 3 types of Action blocks:

- `match`
- `fuzz`
- `alert`
- `request`

We will enter in more details for each of these action blocks, but here is the general structure of a custom security check, with a simple example check HTTP response codes.


```yaml
custom_checks:
  - name: 'http_resp_codes'
    matchers:
      - match:
          - or: # if resp codes are between 0-199 OR 600-999
              - response_code:
                gt: 0
                lt: 199
              - response_code:
                gt: 600
                lt: 999
        alert: # then we raise an alert
          name: Bad HTTP code
          title_on_pass: HTTP codes OK
          title_on_fail: Bad HTTP codes detected
          context: |
            ....
          description: |
            ...
          remediation: |
            ...
        severity: INFO
```
