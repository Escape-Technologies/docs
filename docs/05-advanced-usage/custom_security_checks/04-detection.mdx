# Detect

Once you've matched/targeted, then fuzzed, then matched again maybe, or directly matched, you can create Alerts !

Taking a few workflow examples:

- Listen for some request/responses and match, then alert ?
  - Useful for detecting suspicious data, bad practices
- Listen for specific scalars in requests or responses, and fuzz them, then, match the fuzzed responses and match the side-effects (using `sent_by_this_check: true`)
  - This is a nice simple way to implement 2 step checks, observe, fuzz, observe response and alert
 

### Detection Section

The `detection` section specifies criteria to detect the success or failure of the security test.

- **Logical Blocks (`and`)

- **Response Checks (`response.status_code`, `response.body`, `response.time`, `response.json`):**
  - Examples: Check status code, body content, response time, and JSON response.

- **Custom Scalars Detection (`helpers.response.scalars`, `helpers.request.scalars`):**
  - Examples: Detect specific scalars like "PASSWORD" or "EMAIL".
