# Custom Security Check Specification Documentation

This documentation outlines the structure and components of a custom security check specification written in YAML. The specification allows for defining security tests with context, actions, detections, and alerts.

## Custom Check Definition



## Explanation of Fields

### Context Section

The `context` section defines conditions under which the security test actions should be executed.

- **Raw HTTP Request (`raw_http`):**
  - Example: Issue a GET request to `/user`. This is run only once at the start of the scan, and will be matched against the Detection section, skipping the Action section (hence, the "raw" name)

- **Property-Based Filters (`key`):**
  - Examples: Filter based on route path, HTTP method, scalar types, and sensitivity.

### Action Section

The `action` section describes the actions to be taken during the security test.

- **Set Key (`set_key`):**
  - Examples: Modify request body, headers, and scalar values.
