## Raw HTTP

If you want to test a specific route, you can use the `http` block to send a raw HTTP request to your API at each scan start.

There are two ways to use the `http` block.

```yaml
http:
  method: GET
  path: /user
  headers:
    Accept: application/json
  query_params:
    email: test@example.com
```

The `http` block is a string that contains a raw HTTP request, with the following format:

```yaml
http:
  raw: |
    GET /user HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
```
