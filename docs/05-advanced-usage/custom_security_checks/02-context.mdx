# Context Filtering

In custom security check implementations, you usually want to match on various criterias to investigate things.

Escape provides a powerful context filtering mechanism to help you do that, thanks to the abstraction of any protocol, any schema, any data type using scalars.

The scanner itself will explore your whole API specification, therefore you can "subscribe" to specific `Exchanges` (request-response objects) using the `context:` section.

The `context:` helps you narrow down what the scanner is exploring and send it to your custom security check.

Of course, you can combine logical operators to create complex filters, the top-level is an AND operator.
