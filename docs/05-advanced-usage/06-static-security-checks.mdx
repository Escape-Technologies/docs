# Static security checks <BetaBadge />

We provide a tool that allows you to send custom requests to any URLs within your organization. This utility is particularly useful for running static security assessments on your web applications, identifying regression bugs, or investigating specialized in-house security concerns.

## Configuring a Static Security Assessment

To initiate a new static security assessment, navigate to the Expert tab in your application settings.

Below is a sample configuration that illustrates a static security assessment aimed at sending a GraphQL query to a specified endpoint. The assessment will then validate if the server's response status is 200.

```json
{
  "custom_checks": [
    {
      "name": "Example-1",
      "severity": "high",
      "http": [
        {
          "user": "public",
          "raw": "@Host: https://[REDACTED]\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: [REDACTED]\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: 194\n\n{\"query\":\"query {\n    debug(test: \\\"y\\\") {\n        id\n        username\n        credit_card {\n            belong_to {\n                id\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\",\"variables\":{}}",
          "matchers": [
            {
              "status": [200],
              "part": "status"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "params": {
}
```

To easily encode your raw request located in a req.txt file, execute the following Python command:

```python
cat req.txt | python -c "import sys; print(''.join(sys.stdin).replace('\n', '\\\\n').replace('\\\\\"', '\\\\\\\\\"').replace('\"', '\\\\\"'))"
```

### API

:::note JSON Schema example

```
{
    "custom_checks": {
        "name": "**value**",                                                            # The name of the check
        "severity": "high | medium | low | info",                                       # The severity of the alert found
        "http": {
            "raw": "**value**",                                                         # The raw request to send
            "user": "**value**",                                                        # The user to use for the request
            "matchers": {
                "part": "status | body | headers | headers_keys | headers_values",      # The part of the response to match
                "regex": ["**value**", ...],                                            # The regex to use for the match
                "status": ["**value**", ...],                                           # The status to match
                "words": ["**value**", ...],                                            # The words to match
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Special Commands

Special commands should be placed at the beginning of the RAW request body.

- @Host: Allows you to manually set the host for the request. Useful for forcing an HTTPS connection.
- @timeout: Allows you to manually set the timeout duration for the request. The default timeout is 5 seconds.
