Integrating Apigee with Escape's Inventory enhances the management of your API ecosystem by incorporating your Postman collections. Here is how to generate a Postman API key for this integration:

### Generating a Postman API Key

Follow these steps to create your API key in Postman:

- Go to your [API Key page](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys) to generate a token.
- Generate a Postman API Key (**not a collection API Key**). For more detailed instructions, refer to the [Postman documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key).
- **Important:** Copy the generated token immediately, as you won't be able to see it again!

By setting up this integration, you ensure that all APIs within your Postman collections are accounted for in Escape's Inventory, aiding in thorough security and compliance assessments.
