Integrating Kong Konnect with Escape's Inventory ensures effective management and monitoring of your Kong APIs, contributing to enhanced security and governance. To establish this integration, you'll need to create a personal access token in Kong Konnect:

### Creating a Kong Konnect Personal Access Token

- Navigate to **Organization > System Accounts** in Kong Konnect.
- This section allows you to create and manage system accounts and their tokens, assign roles, and handle team memberships.
- For detailed, step-by-step instructions, refer to the [official Kong documentation](https://docs.konghq.com/konnect/org-management/system-accounts/).

Creating a personal access token in Kong Konnect and configuring this integration enables Escape's Inventory to effectively monitor and manage API activity, ensuring your API infrastructure is secure and compliant.

### Internal Networks and Services

If you are integrating Escape's Inventory with internal networks and services, you may need to configure the Escape Reverse Proxy or whitelist FQDNs in order for the integration to function properly. For more information about whitelisting FQDNs, see the [Internal Networks & Services](/inventory/where/intranet).
