Integrating Kubernetes with Escape's Inventory will allow Escape to discover services running on your Kubernetes cluster.

### Discovered resources

Escape will read your [services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) and [ingresses](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) you defined in your cluster.

This services will be tested to know it these are APIs then you will be able to se them in the services section of the inventory.

### Configuration

To enable the Kubernetes integration, you need to set up a [Private Location as a Kubernetes deployment](/platform/enterprise/private-location#kubernetes-deployment).

To allow this deployment to access resources in your Kubernetes cluster, you need to create a Service Account and a ClusterRoleBinding.

Here is the sample YAML to create these authorizations (replace `default` with the right namespace if needed):

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: escape-repeater
  namespace: default
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: escape-repeater
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["namespaces"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["services"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
  - apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io"]
    resources: ["ingresses"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: escape-repeater
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: escape-repeater
    namespace: default # the namespace where the ServiceAccount is created
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: escape-repeater
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Finally, add `serviceAccountName: escape-repeater` to the `spec` section of your deployment to bind the Service Account to the pod.
