### Internal Networks and Services

If you are integrating Escape's Inventory with internal networks and services, you may need to configure a Private Location or whitelist FQDNs in order for the integration to function properly. For more information about whitelisting FQDNs, see the [Internal Networks & Services](/inventory/where/intranet).
