Integrating GitLab with Escape's Inventory enhances your ability to manage and secure APIs across your GitLab repositories. Hereâ€™s how you can create a personal access token for secure and efficient integration:

### Creating a GitLab Personal Access Token

- Create a new Personal Access Token in your [GitLab settings](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens).
- Under **Scopes**, select `api`, `read_api`, and `read_repository` to ensure the token has the necessary permissions to interact securely with your repositories.
- **Important:** Copy and secure your token immediately after creation, as it cannot be viewed again once you navigate away from the token generation page.

For additional guidance, refer to the [GitLab documentation on Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html).

This integration facilitates a seamless connection between Escape's Inventory and your GitLab environment, allowing for comprehensive monitoring and management of API exposure and security within your projects.

### Internal Networks and Services

If you are integrating Escape's Inventory with internal networks and services, you may need to configure a Private Location or whitelist FQDNs in order for the integration to function properly. For more information about whitelisting FQDNs, see the [Internal Networks & Services](/inventory/where/intranet).
