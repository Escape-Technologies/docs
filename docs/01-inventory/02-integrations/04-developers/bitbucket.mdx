Integrating Bitbucket with Escape's Inventory allows for enhanced visibility into your repositories, ensuring that API endpoints and secrets within your Bitbucket projects are accurately cataloged. Follow these concise steps to create a Bitbucket Workspace Access Token required for integration:

### Creating a Bitbucket Workspace Access Token

- Create a new Worksapce Access Token in your [Bitbucket Settings](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/workspace-access-tokens/).
- Under **Scopes**, select `project` and `repository` to ensure the token has the necessary permissions to interact securely with your repositories.
- **Important:** Copy and secure your token immediately after creation, as it cannot be viewed again once you navigate away from the token generation page.

This token will allow Escape's Inventory to access and analyze your Bitbucket repositories securely and non-intrusively, maintaining your organization's data privacy and security.

### Internal Networks and Services

If you are integrating Escape's Inventory with internal networks and services, you may need to configure a Private Location or whitelist FQDNs in order for the integration to function properly. For more information about whitelisting FQDNs, see the [Internal Networks & Services](/inventory/where/intranet).
