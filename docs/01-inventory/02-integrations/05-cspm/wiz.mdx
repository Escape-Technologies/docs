Integrating Wiz with Escape's Inventory allows for enhanced visibility into your attack surface exposure, ensuring that API endpoints are truly secured from an external point of view.
Escape will also push its DAST findings to Wiz through the External Enrichment feature, allowing you to have a comprehensive view of your security posture.
This is currently a preview feature, please reach out to us if you would like to try it out.


### Creating a Wiz Service Account

Escape needs a few details to connect to your Wiz account.

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Token url
- API Endpoint url

1. **Getting your API Endpoint URL**:
   - Navigate to your user profile and copy the API Endpoint URL.

2. **Getting your Client ID and secret**:
   - In the Wiz dashboard Navigate to Settings > Service Accounts.
   - Click Add Service Account.
   - Name the new service account, for example: Escape Integration.
   - If you desire, narrow the scope of this service account to specific projects.
   - Select the following permissions
      - read:resources
      - read:network_exposure
      - read:projects
      - create:external_data_ingestion (for External Enrichment)
      - read:system_activities (for External Enrichment)

   - Click Add Service Account
   - Copy the Client Secret. Note that you won't be able to copy it after this stage.
