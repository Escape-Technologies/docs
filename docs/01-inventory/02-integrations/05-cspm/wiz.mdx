Integrating Wiz with Escape's Inventory allows for enhanced visibility into your attack surface exposure, ensuring that API endpoints are truly secured from an external point of view.


### Creating a Wiz Service Account

Escape needs a few details to connect to your Wiz account.

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Token url
- API Endpoint url

1. **Getting your API Endpoint URL**:
   - Navigate to your user profile and copy the API Endpoint URL.

2. **Getting your Client ID and secret**:
   - In the Wiz dashboard Navigate to Settings > Service Accounts.
   - Click Add Service Account.
   - Name the new service account, for example: Escape Integration.
   - If you desire, narrow the scope of this service account to specific projects.
   - Select the following permissions
      - read:resources
      - read:network_exposure
      - read:projects
   - Click Add Service Account
   - Copy the Client Secret. Note that you won't be able to copy it after this stage.
   - Copy the Client ID, which is displayed under the Service Accounts page.

Done !
