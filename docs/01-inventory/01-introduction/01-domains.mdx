## Start with one single Domain Name {#minimal-mandatory-input:-one-single-domain-name}

The main input is the companyâ€™s primary domain name. This subdomain represents the minimal Scope of Exploration for the Inventory.

Escape employs subdomain enumeration techniques combined with intelligent brute-force methods and crawling (including API Discovery from Frontend Code) to visit and inspect a wide array of URLs. Each URL is then fingerprinted.

Escape uses AI-powered fingerprinting to identify and classify Application Assets by analyzing various characteristics, such as structure, endpoints, and response patterns. This AI-based approach allows for high-accuracy detection and categorization of various Application types, even for unique or non-standard configurations.


## Add more Domains and Subdomains

Escape's minimal input is one single domain name, but using the Bulk Edit feature you can add as many domains and subdomains in the Exploratoin Scope.
