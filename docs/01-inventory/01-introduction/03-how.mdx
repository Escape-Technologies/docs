### Overview

Getting started with Escape's Inventory is streamlined and user-friendly, requiring minimal effort from the user. Once you register with your professional email address, the inventory begins to build automatically, leveraging AI to intelligently catalog all relevant APIs and secrets associated with your organization's domain.

### Initial Setup

The setup process is virtually instantaneous:

- **Automatic Inventory Creation**: Immediately after registration, our system uses your email domain to automatically identify and begin cataloging APIs and potential secret leakages. This process is fully automated, taking only a few minutes to provide a comprehensive API and secrets inventory.
- **Customization Options**: While the initial inventory setup requires no user input, the platform offers extensive customization options through the "Exploration Scope" and "Extraction Filters". AI-generated suggestions help refine these settings to better fit your specific security and operational needs.

### System Requirements

As a SaaS platform, there are no specific setup requirements to begin using Escape's Inventory. However, for organizations looking to extend inventory capabilities to internal APIs and secrets:

- **Repeater Proxy**: Optionally, you can install the Repeater Proxy within your network to detect and catalog internal APIs and secrets. This lightweight agent can be set up in just a few minutes and works across all standard networks.

### User Access and Permissions

Access and permissions within the Inventory are managed via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), detailed in another section of this documentation. This ensures that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive inventory data, aligning with best security practices.

### Integrations

Escape's Inventory seamlessly integrates with a variety of development tools and platforms, enhancing both the depth and breadth of the inventory process:

- **Developer Tools**: Integrations with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Postman enrich the inventory with data directly from your development environment.
- **API Gateways**: Connections with API gateways such as Azure, AWS, and Kong allow for a thorough cataloging of both external and internal APIs.
- **Legacy Systems**: The platform can also integrate with traditional ASPM and cataloging solutions like Backstage, providing a bridge between new and existing API management practices.

### Tips for First Use

For the most effective use of the Inventory:

- **Explore AI Suggestions**: Engage with the AI-generated suggestions for exploration scope and extraction filters. These are designed to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the inventory.
- **Fine-Tune Settings**: Experiment with customizing the scope and filters based on the initial insights provided by the inventory. Adjustments can be made easily to better capture the unique aspects of your API landscape.

By following these guidelines, you can maximize the capabilities of Escape's Inventory from day one, ensuring a robust and responsive API and secrets management framework.
