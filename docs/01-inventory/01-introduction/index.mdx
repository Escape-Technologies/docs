Escape Inventory is uniquely capable of detecting and classifying Application Assets exposed by an organization without requiring any agent or traffic interception.

## Supported Application Assets:

* **APIs:** REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, SOAP, etc.  
* **API Schemas:** OpenAPI Specification, GraphQL Introspection, Postman Collections, etc.  
* **Web Apps:** Frontends, Single Page Applications (SPA), etc.

## Fingerprinted Characteristics of Application Assets:

* **Network Scope:** External, Internal  
* **Status:** Current, Zombie, Legacy, Shadow  
* **Environment:** Production, Staging, Development  
* **Technology:** REST, GraphQL, etc.  
* **Framework:** Flask, Laravel, Next.js, etc.  
* **Cloud Hosting:** AWS, Azure, OVH, Akamai, GCP, etc.  
* **Firewall:** Cloudflare, AWS ELB, Azure WAF, Akamai Firewall, etc.  
* **Authentication:** Keycloak, Auth0, API Key, etc.

## Risk Detection for Exposed APIs

* Leakage of Sensitive Data and Secrets  
* External Exposure  
* Disclosure of API Documentation  
* Lack of Authentication or Authorization  
* Detection of Critical Vulnerabilities

## Output

![The Escape API Services Inventory](api-inventory.png)

The output consists of four filterable, sortable, and searchable dataframes listing all detected and fingerprinted Application Assets.

* **Dataframe 1:** **API Services** ‚Äì Represents root API services, each potentially encompassing multiple API Endpoints exposed on the Internet. Escape can detect or generate the associated API Schema, which contains multiple API Endpoints.  
* **Dataframe 2:** **API Schemas** ‚Äì Offers a schema-first perspective on API Services. This view is especially valuable as some API Schemas, although detected within the research scope, are not linked to any specific API Service.  
* **Dataframe 3:** **Frontends** ‚Äì Lists all detected web applications, frontends, and SPAs within the research scope.
* **Dataframe 4:** **Sensitive Data & Secrets** ‚Äì List all potential Senstive Data and Secret exposed on the Internet with a very low false positive rate, considering factors like the surrounding code, data flow, and access patterns.
