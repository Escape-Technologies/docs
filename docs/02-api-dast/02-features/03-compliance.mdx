In the evolving landscape of cyber threats, adhering to compliance standards is often a mandate rather than just a best practice. The ability to swiftly generate and align security reports with globally recognized standards is essential for enterprises, not only for internal reviews but also for external scrutiny. Escape's Compliance feature ensures that your organization remains audit-ready at all times, actively assisting in addressing vulnerabilities and strengthening your applications.

## Discover and Secure: Inventory and Testing

Escape is designed around two core functionalities:

- **Inventory**: Discover all APIs within your organization, whether they are widely used or operate in the shadows. This comprehensive visibility is crucial for understanding and managing your API landscape.
  
- **Testing**: Secure your APIs by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities. Escape supports extensive testing capabilities, facilitating the integration of security directly into your development processes.

These two pillars are reflected in the structure of this documentation, divided into sections focusing on **Inventory** and **Testing** respectively, ensuring that you have all the necessary information to manage and secure your APIs effectively.

## Guided Vulnerability Remediation

Escape does more than identify compliance gaps:

- **Interactive Guidance**: Escape not only flags vulnerabilities but also guides users in addressing them, ensuring applications are not just compliant but genuinely secure.
- **Pass/Fail Indicators**: Provides clear visibility into which security tests have been passed or failed, offering actionable insights that help prioritize and address compliance-related vulnerabilities effectively.

## A Glance at Your Organization's Compliance: The Compliance Matrix
