Every time Escape detects a new sensitive data type, an alert is triggered. This sensitive data can be closely examined in the "Sensitive Data" tab. Alerts come with rich contextual information, such as whether the data is publicly accessible, enhancing your understanding of the risk associated with each data type.

### Compliance

Identifying sensitive data not only aids in avoiding data leaks but is also critical for maintaining compliance with major standards and regulations. This feature is essential for organizations that must comply with standards such as:
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- [And many more](https://docs.escape.tech/features/compliance)
