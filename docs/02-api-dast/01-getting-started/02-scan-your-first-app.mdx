# ðŸ”Ž Start your first scan

## Application creation stepper

1. Go to your [applications list](https://app.escape.tech) and click on `Secure a new app`
2. Choose between `GraphQL` and `REST`
3. For `REST` applicatins, you will be required to provide either a Swagger v2, OpenAPI v3 or Postman Collection file.
2. Enter your endpoint and click on `Next`
3. Add an authorization header if desired or click on `Skip`
4. Select a name for the application, and select if you want the scan to run in development (read-write mode) or production (read-only) environment.
5. You are all set!

## Common pitfalls

### My endpoint is not a valid endpoint

It might occur that we cannot detect if an API endpoint is valid. In the case it is legit, you might want to [discuss with us](https://discord.escape.tech).

### Your endpoint requires authentication

<Image img={require('./img/not-a-graphql-endpoint.png')} alt="test"/>

A common reason for our test to fail is also that the endpoint requires authentication parameters, whether it be a firewall protecting the server, or an application layer ensuring authentication for the query we use in order to fingerprint the API (`query { __typename }`). In this case, you are offered to provide authorization headers, that will be attached to the HTTP requests we send.
