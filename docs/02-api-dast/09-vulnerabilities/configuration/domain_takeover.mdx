# domain takeover

## Description

Domain takeover occurs when an attacker gains control of a domain due to misconfigurations, expired services, or DNS vulnerabilities. This allows the attacker to redirect traffic, impersonate the domain, and potentially steal sensitive information.

## Remediation

1. Remove or update DNS records that point to unused or expired domains.
2. Implement strict access controls and regularly audit domain ownership.
3. Use domain registrar features like domain locking to prevent unauthorized changes.
4. Regularly monitor and renew domain registrations to prevent expiration.
5. Implement security measures such as DNSSEC to protect DNS records.
6. Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential domain vulnerabilities.
7. Educate staff on the importance of domain security and best practices.
