# AWS Config Exposure

## Description

Detects exposed AWS configuration files at /.aws/config, potentially revealing sensitive credentials.

## Remediation

To remediate AWS Config Exposure, follow these steps:

1. Review the AWS Config rules and ensure they are configured to monitor for unintended changes and compliance with your security policies.
2. Modify the AWS Config service role to restrict permissions, ensuring it has only the necessary access to perform its functions.
3. Enable encryption for AWS Config data using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to protect the data at rest.
4. Regularly audit and rotate IAM credentials and keys to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
5. Implement least privilege access by ensuring that only necessary permissions are granted to IAM roles and users that interact with AWS Config.
6. Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all actions taken by AWS Config, including configuration changes and data access.
7. Review and update security groups and network access control lists (NACLs) to restrict network access to AWS Config resources.
8. Regularly review and update your AWS Config rules and remediation actions to ensure they align with the latest security best practices.
9. Enable AWS Config conformance packs to apply a group of AWS Config rules and remediation actions across an entire organization or specific accounts.
