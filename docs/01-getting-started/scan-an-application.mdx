# ðŸ”Ž Start your first scan

In its most simple form, an API endpoint is **everything we need to start scans on a GraphQL API.**

## Application creation stepper

1. Go to your [applications list](https://app.escape.tech) and click on `Secure a new app`
2. Enter your GraphQL endpoint and click on `Next`
3. Add an authorization header if desired or click on `Skip`
4. Select a name for the application, and select if you want the scan to send `queries` and `mutations` (read-write mode), or only `queries` (read-only, safe for production). Click on `Start scanning`.
5. You are all set!

## Common pitfalls

### My endpoint is not a GraphQL endpoint

It might occur that we cannot detect if an API endpoint is powered by a GraphQL engine. In the case it is legit not a GraphQL endpoint and you might want to [discuss with us](https://discord.escape.tech) to be early testers of non-graphql APIs security tests.

### My endpoint is a GraphQL endpoint but requires authentication

A common reason for our test to fail is also that the endpoint requires authentication parameters, whether it be a firewall protecting the server, or an application layer ensuring authentication for the query we use in order to fingerprint the API (`query { __typename }`). In this case, you are offered to provide authorization headers, that will be attached to the HTTP requests we send.
