# ðŸ‘¤ Create your account

The very first step to use Escape is to [create an account](https://app.escape.tech/register) on our security platform. As of today, we offer two methods for creating an account:

1. `email/password` combination: You will have to confirm your email with an email that will be sent to this address
2. `Google SSO`: You can register & login instantly using a google account. Since we do not allow `@gmail.com` addresses, you will be required to use a [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.fr/) account.
3. `GitHub SSO`: You can register & login instantly using a GitHub account.

## Professional emails

:::caution
Escape is for professional use only. In order to start using our security platform, it is necessary to register with your business email.
:::

Regardless of if you register using an email/password combination or through single-sign-on (using Google), the business email rule is enforced.

The following is a non-exhaustive example list of common emails domain names that we currently reject:

- `yopmail.com`
- `gmail.com`
- `live.com`
- `icloud.com`

## Organizations

Once you registered with a business email, `me@my-business.com`, an organization named `my-business.com`
is created and linked to your account. Every further registrations using that domain name will be linked to this organization.

:::info
The organization is tightly coupled to your domain name, and it will be verified by Escape's staff following your registration.
:::

If your domain is valid and approved, well you are all set to start a scan ! If ever your domain name is rejected by our staff, you will be notified by email. If this were to be a mistake from us, please reach out to us on our [Discord community server](https://discord.escape.tech)
