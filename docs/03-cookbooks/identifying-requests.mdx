# üêº Whitelist scanner requests

You might need to identify when the request you receive is coming from the security scanner.

For instance, you probably don't want the many requests being sent to your server from the scanner to appear in your monitoring tool, or, you might want to enable the introspection of your server only to the security scanner on your staging environment.

## Using the 'x-escape-identifier' HTTP Header

Escape's scanner sends a secure token attached to every requests it sends. The header name is `x-escape-identifier` and its value is an identification token attached to your organization.

```http
x-escape-identifier: {{your-escape-identifier}}
```

Thanks to this header you can detect incoming requests from the scanner in your server, to add any custom handling logic you might want on top of this.

You can find this token in your [organization settings](https://app.escape.tech/organization/settings/).

You should keep this token secret. If you think it has been compromised, you can regenerate it in your [organization settings](https://app.escape.tech/organization/settings/) using the `Revoke` button.

## Using Proxy

If you want do scan an application behind a firewall, you may need to use our static ip proxy to access it.

Check the [Client](https://escape.tech/docs/advanced-usage/parameters#client) section of our Advanced Configuration documentation.

All requests sent by the scanner will be sent to your application through this proxy.
The following IPs are used :

- IPv4 : `163.172.168.233`
- IPv6 : `2001:bc8:47a4:61f::1`
