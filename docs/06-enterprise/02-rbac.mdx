# RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a cornerstone of modern access management, ensuring that users have the exact permissions they needâ€”no more, no less. Escape's RBAC features allow organizations to meticulously define roles and fine-grained permissions, ensuring robust security, streamlined operations, and maximized productivity.

Escape's RBAC is accessible under the "Organization" Settings, and at the "Application" settings level.

## Core Roles

Escape defines several out-of-the-box roles that grant specific sets of permissions, catering to various organizational needs:

- **Manage Roles**: Allows users to define, modify, or delete roles within the organization.
- **Edit Organization**: Grants permission to modify organizational details and settings.
- **Create Application**: Enables users to initiate new applications within the platform.
- **Invite Members**: Entrusts users with the ability to bring new members into the organization.
- **Manage Billing**: Grants access to financial and subscription-related settings and information.
- **Delete Organization**: A high-level permission allowing users to delete the entire organization; typically reserved for top-level admins.
- **Manage Integrations**: Enables users to add, modify, or remove third-party integrations and their settings.

## Fine-Grained Application Permissions

Beyond the core roles, Escape provides the flexibility to define permissions at the granular application level. This ensures that users or business units can be restricted or permitted to specific applications, aligning with their job responsibilities and the principle of least privilege.

### **Example**:
A user in the 'Marketing' business unit may be granted read-only access to the 'Analytics App' but may not have any access to the 'Finance App'.

### Features:

- **Individual Permissions**: Set permissions on a per-user basis for each application.

- **Inheritance**: Easily copy permissions from one user or group to another, ensuring consistency and saving time.
