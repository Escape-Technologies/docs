3. Use Azure Policy to audit and enforce security controls that prevent Tenant ID exposure.
4. Regularly audit your Azure environment for exposed Tenant IDs and take corrective actions if any are found.
5. Educate users and developers about the risks of exposing sensitive information, including Tenant IDs.
6. Ensure that logging and monitoring are in place to detect any unauthorized access or exposure of Tenant IDs.
