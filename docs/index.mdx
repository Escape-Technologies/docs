## Understanding Escape

Escape is engineered to assist organizations in two fundamental ways: **Discovering (Inventory) and Securing (Testing) APIs**. Our platform is split into two main sections:

- **Inventory**: Explore and catalog all your APIs, both internal and external. This section helps you gain visibility into your API landscape, identifying everything from mainstream to shadow and legacy APIs without requiring traffic monitoring or agents.
- **Testing**: Focus on securing your APIs by detecting and mitigating vulnerabilities. Escape supports extensive testing capabilities for GraphQL and REST applications, allowing you to find and fix security weaknesses during your development process.

Escape operates outside of your stack, ensuring compatibility with all GraphQL and REST implementations and providing a `Read-Only` mode that is safe for production environments. This external operation means there is **no downtime** for your applications, safeguarding both your operations and your customers.
