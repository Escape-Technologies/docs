Welcome to the official documentation for Escape, your comprehensive resource for discovering and securing all the APIs within your organization. Whether you're new to Escape or looking to enhance your existing implementation, our documentation is designed to guide you through every step of the process. This includes everything from initial setup and advanced configuration to alerting and integrations.

## Understanding Escape

Escape helps Security Teams quickly find and protect every Web Application and API they expose, with no need for complex setup or network changes. By focusing on Security Teams in medium and large organizations, Escape addresses the unique challenges these experts face when managing large and growing technology stacks. The platform is provided as a SaaS solution and centers around three key capabilities:
- **Agentless Inventory** (APIs and Web Apps **EASM**): Automatically discovers, classifies, and tracks all application assets exposed by an organization (without the use of agents or network traffic analysis).
- **Security Testing at Scale**: Runs Security Testing on the application assets discovered by the Inventory.
- **Modern DAST in CI/CD** (**Dynamic Application Security Testing**): Runs business logic security tests on APIs and Web Applications (including SPAs) and provide remediations directly in the CI/CD pipeline, starting at the development phase.

By providing full visibility and continuous testing, Escape helps organizations stay ahead of potential risks, ensuring customers gain a more complete and proactive approach to Application Security. 

Escape operates outside of your stack and is safe for production environments. This external operation means there is **no downtime** for your applications, safeguarding both your operations and your customers.
