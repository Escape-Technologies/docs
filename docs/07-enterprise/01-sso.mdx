title: SSO and Identity Federation
---

Leveraging Auth0, Escape supports all common enterprise authentication methods, including SSO, Identity Federation, SAML, etc. for Enterprise Users. This allows you to use your existing identity provider to authenticate to Escape, and to manage your users from a single place. Using an enterprise identity provider also allows you to enforce your organization's security policies, such as multi-factor authentication, password complexity, etc. **making it easier and safer for your users to access Escape.**

Escape supports the following enterprise providers out of the box:

- [Active Directory/LDAP](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/active-directory-ldap)
- [ADFS](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/adfs)
- [Azure Active Directory Native](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/azure-active-directory-native) and [Azure Active Directory](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/azure-active-directory/v2)
- [Google Workspace](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/google-apps)
- [OpenID Connect](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/oidc)
- [Okta](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/okta)
- [PingFederate](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/ping-federate)
- [SAML 2.0](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/saml), which allows you to connect to any SAML compliant identity provider
