# Private Locations

## Overview

Private Locations enable secure detection, fingerprinting, and scanning of internal applications behind your organization’s firewall or VPN. This is achieved through the Escape Repeater, a lightweight, open-source tool developed in Golang. The Repeater establishes a reverse tunnel between Escape and your internal network, providing a secure channel for performing scans and retrieving results.

### Infrastructure Workflow

1. The locally deployed Repeater connects to the Repeater manager.
2. When a scan is initiated, Escape sends requests to the Repeater manager rather than directly to your servers.
3. The Repeater manager forwards the requests to the local Repeater, which relays them to your internal applications.
4. Scan results are then returned to Escape for reporting and analysis.

## Getting Started with Private Locations

Escape's Private Locations can be easily deployed using the Repeater, an open-source Docker image, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/Repeater). It can be deployed using Docker CLI, Docker Compose, or other container orchestration tools.

### Resource Requirements

 The resource requirements depend on expected traffic; a 1 vCPU instance with 2GB RAM is typically sufficient to start, with usage monitored and scaled as necessary.

### Basic Deployment

To deploy the Repeater, configure it with the following environment variable:
- `ESCAPE_REPEATER_ID`: Unique ID for your Private Location.

Example deployment command:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --name escape-repeater \
    -e ESCAPE_REPEATER_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx \
    escapetech/repeater:latest
```

More deployment examples are available in the example folder of the GitHub repository. Contributions for additional configurations are welcome.

### Firewall Configuration

To connect your Repeater to Escape, ensure that **outgoing** connections to `repeater.escape.tech` on `TCP` port `443` are allowed. Use the command `nslookup repeater.escape.tech` to retrieve current IPs if firewall configurations are IP-specific.

#### Required Outgoing IPs (as of 2024/09/09):

| Address          | Protocol     | Port  |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| `52.6.17.196`    | `TCP`/`GRPC` | `443` |
| `44.210.73.138`  | `TCP`/`GRPC` | `443` |
| `54.172.108.134` | `TCP`/`GRPC` | `443` |

Additional IPs for stability:

| Address          | Protocol      | Port  |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| `51.159.205.221` | `TCP`/`HTTP`  | `80`  |
| `51.159.205.221` | `TCP`/`HTTPS` | `443` |


## Connecting a Private Location

1. Visit the [Network Configuration](https://app.staging.escape.tech/organization/network/) page.
2. Create a new Private Location or select an existing one.
3. Follow deployment instructions provided on the Network page. The Repeater is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/escapetech/repeater).
4. Connection status updates every minute in the **Last seen** column.

## Using a Private Location with Applications

### Adding to a New Application
When setting up a new application in Escape, choose a Private Location to enable scanning for internal applications.

### Configuring for an Existing Application
In the application’s Advanced Settings, add the following configuration to specify the Repeater:

```yaml
client:
  proxy:
    type: repeater
  target: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx # Replace with your Repeater ID
```

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Custom CA Certificate

For environments that require a custom CA certificate:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --name escape-repeater \
    -v /path/to/ca.crt:/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca.crt \
    -e ESCAPE_REPEATER_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx \
    escapetech/repeater:latest
```

### Allowing SSL Connections

To allow insecure connections, set `ESCAPE_REPEATER_INSECURE=true`:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --name escape-repeater \
    -e ESCAPE_REPEATER_INSECURE=true \
    -e ESCAPE_REPEATER_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx \
    escapetech/repeater:latest
```

### Using mTLS

To enable mTLS (mutual TLS), configure the following variables:

- `ESCAPE_REPEATER_mTLS_CRT_FILE`: Path to the mTLS certificate.
- `ESCAPE_REPEATER_mTLS_KEY_FILE`: Path to the mTLS private key.

Example command:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --name escape-repeater \
    -v /path/to/mtls.crt:/usr/local/share/mtls.crt \
    -v /path/to/mtls.key:/usr/local/share/mtls.key \
    -e ESCAPE_REPEATER_mTLS_CRT_FILE=/usr/local/share/mtls.crt \
    -e ESCAPE_REPEATER_mTLS_KEY_FILE=/usr/local/share/mtls.key \
    -e ESCAPE_REPEATER_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx \
    escapetech/repeater:latest
```

To declare users with and without mTLS, add the `repeater_mtls: true` flag:

```yaml
users:
  # without mTLS
  - name: public

  # with mTLS
  - name: using-mtls
    repeater_mtls: true
```

### Proxy Configuration for Escape Connection

If a proxy is required to connect the Repeater to Escape, configure it using `ESCAPE_REPEATER_PROXY_URL`. Note: the proxy must support HTTP/2 as gRPC connections are used.

Example:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --name escape-repeater \
    -e ESCAPE_REPEATER_PROXY_URL=http://user:pass@my-proxy.server.tld:1234 \
    -e ESCAPE_REPEATER_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx \
    escapetech/repeater:latest
```

This concludes the setup and usage guide for Escape’s Private Locations.
