## Private Tenant

### What is a Private Tenant?

A SaaS platform typically offers a shared infrastructure for multiple customers. In the case of Escape, this means that customers execute scans on the same underlying servers, and store their results on the same data stores.

Customers can also run Escape scans on their own instance of Escape. This does not mean that we will run scans on the customer's own servers, but that we will provision separate servers and data stores in our infrastructure for the customer.

### What are the benefits of a private tenant?

- **Enhanced Security**: Running Escape on dedicated hardware improves security by eliminating potential malware infections and unauthorized data access from other tenants.
- **Improved Performance and Reliability**: Customers in a private tenant have full access to infrastructure resources that can lead to better and more consistent performance.

### Prerequisites

Private tenants are deployed on AWS. Deployment to other cloud providers can be added, as needed. Escape fully manages the deployment process for you.

## On-Prem Deployment

### What is On-Prem Deployment?

On-prem deployment allows organizations to run Escape directly on their own hardware and within their own data centers. This option is ideal for enterprises that require full control over their data and infrastructure due to regulatory requirements or specific security policies.

### Simplicity of On-Prem Deployment

Deploying Escape on-prem is designed to be as simple as possible:

- **Easy Setup**: Escape provides a straightforward installation process that integrates seamlessly with your existing infrastructure.
- **Full Control**: Manage all aspects of the deployment, from hardware to software configurations, ensuring that it aligns perfectly with your organizational needs.
- **Direct Integration**: Easily connect with internal systems and databases without the need to transmit data outside your corporate environment.

### Benefits of On-Prem Deployment

- **Complete Data Sovereignty**: Retain full control over where and how your data is stored and processed.
- **Customized Security**: Enhance your security measures by integrating Escape with your internal security protocols and tools.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet strict compliance standards that require data to be handled and processed within your physical premises.

### Prerequisites

The only requirement for on-prem deployment is that your infrastructure must meet the technical specifications provided by Escape, ensuring optimal performance and compatibility.
