---

At Escape, we understand that security is not just a task for the security team but a collective effort that involves every developer in the organization. We believe that effective security practices are best implemented when developers and security teams collaborate seamlessly. To support this, Escape provides robust tools designed to bridge the gap between these groups, ensuring that security becomes an integral part of the development process.

### Emphasizing Collaboration

Escape's platform is built to foster collaboration by enabling both security teams and developers to understand and act on security findings effectively. Our tools are designed to provide clarity and actionable insights, making it easier for teams to communicate and collaborate on security-related issues.

### Workflows: Automating Security Integration

Escape's workflows allow teams to create custom automations that leverage results from both the Inventory and Testing phases. These automations can streamline the process of detecting vulnerabilities, prioritizing them, and assigning remediation tasks directly within the developers' workflows. This integration ensures that security considerations are embedded within the development cycle, from inception through deployment.

### Enterprise Features

Escape is equipped with enterprise-grade features that meet the rigorous demands of large organizations:

- **Advanced Authentication**: Supports standard enterprise authentication mechanisms, including SAML, enhancing security and simplifying user management.
- **Comprehensive Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing enterprise systems and workflows, ensuring that Escape adapts to your organization's specific needs without disrupting existing processes.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Designed to scale with your organization, whether you're managing dozens or thousands of APIs.

### Security as a Team Sport

The journey to fixing a vulnerability involves several stages: discovery, prioritization, and remediation. Escape supports each of these steps by:

1. **Discovery**: Identifying vulnerabilities efficiently through automated testing and inventory management.
2. **Prioritization**: Using AI-driven insights to highlight vulnerabilities that pose the greatest risk and should be addressed first.
3. **Remediation**: Facilitating quick and effective fixes by providing developers with the tools and information they need to resolve issues without delay.

By integrating these processes into a cohesive workflow, Escape ensures that security is a collective responsibility embraced by the entire tech team.

### Conclusion

Escapeâ€™s collaboration and enterprise features are designed not just to meet the technical specifications of large organizations but also to cultivate a culture of security throughout the development process. With Escape, security becomes a shared goal, achieved through the continuous collaboration of security teams and developers.
