# üëñ Slack notifications

To configure a new Slack webhook and receive notifications of new vulnerabilities directly in your favorite channel, head to the [integrations page](https://app.escape.tech/integrations/) and click **Connect** in the **Slack** section.

The page will ask you:

1. What applications you want to receive notifications for.<br/>
   You can select **All applications** if you want to receive notifications for all your applications, or select specific applications.
2. A Slack webhook URL. ([See below how to get one.](#-get-a-slack-webhook-url))
3. What kind of notifications you want to receive.<br/>
   Escape can notify you of scan results and configuration issues.

Click the **Save** and you're done!
