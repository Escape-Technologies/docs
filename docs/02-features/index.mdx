# Security Features

In the contemporary cybersecurity landscape, it's no longer adequate for organizations to merely react to threats post facto. Proactiveness, granularity in visibility, and strategic control over one's digital assets are paramount. This holistic approach demands not just a reactive Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) but a comprehensive suite that encapsulates a range of features designed to augment an organization's security posture.

## Key Features:

- **Attack Surface Management**: Obtain a comprehensive view of all the GraphQL endpoints that might be exposed to potential threats. This component helps in proactive threat identification and mitigation, ensuring that potential avenues for infiltration are minimized.

- **Security Posture Management**: Consolidate and visualize the robustness of your organization's defenses in real-time. Understand where you stand, what you're doing right, and what needs immediate attention.

- **Contextual remediations**: Enable your team to focus on fixing what genuinely threatens your infrastructure. Vulnerabilities are not only detected but also analyzed and prioritized within the context of your organization's specific risks.

- **Custom Security Rules**: Tailor your security protocols to meet the unique requirements of your organization. Instead of generic rules that might overlook intricate vulnerabilities, create policies that align with your organization's operational dynamics.

- **Compliance**: Seamlessly adhere to industry-standard regulations. Whether it's OWASP TOP 10, GDPR, HIPPA, PCI-DSS, or any other standard, ensure that your digital operations are compliant, thereby avoiding legal entanglements and fortifying stakeholder trust.

- **Reporting**: Generate in-depth and insightful reports that not only satisfy auditor demands but also provide value to stakeholders ranging from executives to clients. Understand vulnerabilities, security progress, and areas of concern in a clear, comprehensive manner.

## Taking Control:

These aforementioned features, when juxtaposed with the reactive capabilities of DAST documented earlier, provide security teams with an arsenal to exert dominion over their organization's digital deployments. By leveraging these tools, teams can:

1. **Gain Visibility**: Unveil every corner of your digital deployment, leaving no room for blind spots that could be exploited.
2. **Assert Compliance**: Ensure that all deployments not only meet but exceed regulatory requirements, solidifying your organization's stance on data protection and user privacy.
3. **Strengthen Communications**: Furnish auditors, stakeholders, partners, and executives with articulate reports that underscore the robustness of your security posture.
4. **Craft Tailored Defenses**: Move beyond generic defenses. Create rules and policies that are tailor-made for your organization's unique needs.

In essence, with these capabilities in hand, security teams are empowered to shift from a position of reactive defense to one of strategic oversight and proactive safeguarding. It's about crafting a security narrative that stands resilient against evolving cyber threats and ensuring that an organization's digital realm remains uncompromised.
