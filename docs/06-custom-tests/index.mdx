title: âš¡ Custom Tests
---

As you already know, [Escape's built-in tests](../vulnerabilities) are
pretty extensive and cover a lot of security vulnerabilities and concerns.
But we know that you might have very specific use-cases, and that's why
we've made it possible for you to create your own custom tests.

These will enable you to build your own governance and apply it at scale,
in a simple language that is powerful thanks to Escape's inference engine.

## Format

A custom test is a YAML file that defines the following blocks:

- [Detectors](./detectors) are used to detect if an alert must be raised by inspecting queries.
- [Alerting](./alerting) is used define the alert format, it's severity ...
- [Seeders](./seeders) are used to seed the scan with requests (optional).
- [Transformations](./transformations) are used to mutate the requests (optional).

## Examples

```yaml
detect:
  - if: "<detect_key>"
    is: "<detect_condition>"
alert:
  name: "<alert_name>"
  severity: "<alert_severity>"
  context: "<alert_context>"
```

```yaml
seed:
  - http:
    raw: |
    <http_request>
transform:
trigger:
  - if: '<trigger_key>'
    is: '<trigger_condition>'
mutate:
  - key: '<mutation_key>'
    name: '<mutation_select>'
    value: '<mutation_value>'
detect:
  - if: '<detect_key>'
    is: '<detect_condition>'
alert:
  name: '<alert_name>'
  severity: '<alert_severity>'
  context: '<alert_context>'
```

### Properties

- `seed:` A list of requests to seed the scan. See [Seeders](./seeders)
- `transform:` Defines lists of triggers and mutations (combined with AND operators).See [Transformations](./transformations)
- `detect:` The conditions to trigger the alert. See [Detectors](./detectors)
- `alert:` The alert to raise if the detection conditions are met. See [Alerting](./alerting)
