title: âš¡ Custom Tests
---

As you already know, [Escape's built-in tests](../vulnerabilities) are pretty extensive and cover a lot of security vulnerabilities and concerns.

But we know that you might have very specific use-cases, and that's why we've made it possible for you to create your own custom tests.

These will enable you to build your own governance and apply it at scale, in a simple language that is powerful thanks to Escape's inference engine.
