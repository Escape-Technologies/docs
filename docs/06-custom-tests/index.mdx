title: ⚡ Custom Tests
---

As you already know, [Escape's built-in tests](../vulnerabilities) are
pretty extensive and cover a lot of security vulnerabilities and concerns.
But we know that you might have very specific use-cases, and that's why
we've made it possible for you to create your own custom tests.

These will enable you to build your own governance and apply it at scale,
in a simple language that is powerful thanks to Escape's inference engine.

## Format

A custom test is a YAML file that defines the following blocks:

- [Alerting](./alerting) is used define the alert format, it's severity…
- [Detectors](./detectors) are used to detect if an alert must be raised by inspecting queries.
- [Transformations](./transformations) are used to mutate the requests (optional).
- [Mutators](./mutators) are used inside the transformations.
- [Seeders](./seeders) are used to seed the scan with requests (optional).

## Examples

```yaml
alert:
  name: Deletion successful
  context: >
    For compliance reasons, the non admin user must not be able to delete some
    data via the API.
  severity: HIGH
detect:
  - if: helpers.request.crud
    is: DELETE
  - if: request.user
    is_not: admin
  - if: helpers.response.is_successful
    is: true
```

### Properties

- `seed`: A list of requests to seed the scan. See [Seeders](./seeders)
- `transform`: Defines lists of triggers and mutations (combined with AND operators).See [Transformations](./transformations)
- `detect`: The conditions to trigger the alert. See [Detectors](./detectors)
- `alert`: The alert to raise if the detection conditions are met. See [Alerting](./alerting)
