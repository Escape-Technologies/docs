The purpose of the project is to **help secure your GraphQL API**: that's how Escape was created. Escape is the world-leading security scanner for GraphQL applications, allowing to **find and fix vulnerabilities during your development process**, whithout the need of any trafic or agent.

Because Escape runs outside of your stack, it **supports all GraphQL implementations** out of the box (present and future). Escape does **not cause any downtime** and has a `Read-Only` mode **safe for your production** and your customers.
