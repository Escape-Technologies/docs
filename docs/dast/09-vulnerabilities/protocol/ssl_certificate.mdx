### REST Specific

<details>
    <summary>Asp_net</summary>

Renew the expired SSL certificate for the website. Ensure that the new certificate is properly installed and configured within the ASP.NET framework's server settings. Set up auto-renewal if possible to prevent future expirations.

<details>
    <summary>Ruby_on_rails</summary>

To address the expired SSL certificate issue in a Ruby on Rails application, you should first acquire a new SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Once obtained, update your server configuration to use the new certificate. For servers running Nginx or Apache, this involves replacing the old certificate files with the new ones and restarting the server. Ensure that your Rails application is configured to force SSL usage with 'config.force_ssl = true' in the 'config/environments/production.rb' file to redirect all traffic over HTTPS. Additionally, set up automatic certificate renewal if your CA supports it to prevent future expirations.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Next_js</summary>

Renew the expired SSL certificate for your Next.js application. Ensure that the new certificate is properly installed and configured on your web server. Set up auto-renewal if possible to prevent future expirations.

<details>
    <summary>Laravel</summary>

To address the expired SSL certificate issue in a Laravel application, you should first acquire a new SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Once you have the new certificate, update your web server configuration to use the new certificate files. For Apache, this involves editing the 'ssl.conf' file or the specific site's configuration file within '/etc/apache2/sites-available/'. For Nginx, you would update the 'nginx.conf' file or the server block file for your site within '/etc/nginx/sites-available/'. After updating the configuration, restart the web server to apply the changes. Additionally, consider setting up auto-renewal for your SSL certificates if your CA provides that service to prevent future expirations.

For Nginx, update the 'ssl_certificate' and 'ssl_certificate_key' directives. After making these changes, restart the web server to apply the new configuration.
