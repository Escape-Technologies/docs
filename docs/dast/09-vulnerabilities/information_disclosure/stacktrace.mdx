title: Stacktrace
---

# Stacktrace

## Description

Details about database-level or code-level errors have been found in the response. This may cause information leaks, allowing attackers to identify the exact database or dependency you are using, and can therefore lead to highly targeted attacks against your application.

Example: sending `getUser(id: null)` returns `{ message: "SQL Error: Postgres 3.6 has encountered an error : Invalid ID."}`.


## Remediation

Always avoid database error codes or stack traces to be returned directly to the client.
Catch all exception and return a specific error code and message.

If you are working in a development or staging environment, error disclosure might happen on purpose.
In that case, check if this is also the case in production by:
- Using our cURL copy button to find the request that generated the stack trace.
- Changing URL and authentication tokens to match your production environment.

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlgo</summary>

To mitigate the risk of injection attacks in a GraphQL Go framework engine, ensure that all user-supplied input is properly validated and sanitized. Use prepared statements with variable binding for all database queries to prevent injection vulnerabilities. Additionally, implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive stack trace information to the client. Regularly review and update your security practices to address new and emerging threats.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

Ensure that the GraphQL Ruby framework is configured to sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks. Use the built-in mechanisms for parameterized queries and argument validation to avoid potential security vulnerabilities. Regularly update the framework and its dependencies to incorporate the latest security patches and features.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Hasura</summary>

To mitigate the risk of SQL injection and ensure secure query handling within the Hasura framework, it is recommended to utilize prepared statements with parameterized queries. This practice prevents attackers from manipulating the SQL syntax by injecting malicious code. Always validate and sanitize user inputs, and employ Hasura's built-in mechanisms for role-based access control to restrict data access and operations based on user roles.

### REST Specific

<details>
    <summary>Asp_net</summary>

Implement custom error handling in the ASP.NET application to catch exceptions and log them internally, while displaying generic error messages to the user. Use the `customErrors` mode in the Web.config file to configure the error pages that should be shown in production, and avoid revealing sensitive error information. Additionally, review and sanitize all error messages to ensure they do not contain details that could help an attacker.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Ruby_on_rails</summary>

In Ruby on Rails, ensure that detailed error messages are not exposed to the end users. Instead, use generic error messages and log the detailed stack traces internally. Configure `config.consider_all_requests_local` to `false` in production to prevent full error reports from being rendered in the browser. Additionally, use `rescue_from` in controllers to catch exceptions and render custom error pages. Always sanitize user inputs and use Active Record's built-in parameterized query methods to prevent SQL injection.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Next_js</summary>

Implement custom error handling in your Next.js application to catch and log errors internally while displaying generic error messages to the users. Avoid sending stack traces or database error details in the response. Use the built-in error pages or create custom error components to provide a user-friendly experience without exposing sensitive information.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Laravel</summary>

In Laravel, ensure that error messages do not expose sensitive details by configuring the 'debug' mode to 'false' in the '.env' file for production environments. Utilize Laravel's built-in logging system to record errors without revealing them to the end user. Additionally, employ exception handling with try-catch blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully, providing generic error responses to the user. For database queries, use Eloquent ORM or the query builder's parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and avoid detailed SQL error messages in responses.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Express_js</summary>

In Express.js, ensure that error handling middleware is configured to catch and sanitize error messages before they are sent to the client. Use a custom error handler that sends generic error responses to avoid leaking stack traces or database information. Additionally, employ logging libraries to record detailed errors internally without exposing them to the end user.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Django</summary>

In Django, ensure that DEBUG mode is set to False in production to prevent stack traces from being displayed to users. Use Django's built-in logging to record errors internally. Additionally, employ Django's exception handling to catch errors and return generic error messages to the client.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Symfony</summary>

In Symfony, ensure that error messages are generic and do not expose stack traces to the end user. Use the 'prod' environment for production, which does not display sensitive error details. Additionally, configure the 'monolog' bundle to log errors internally without exposing them to the client. For database interactions, utilize Doctrine's parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and avoid detailed error messages that could reveal database structure or version information.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Spring_boot</summary>

In Spring Boot, ensure that detailed error messages are not exposed to the client. Configure a global exception handler using `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` annotations to catch exceptions and return a generic error response. Additionally, enable `spring.mvc.log-resolved-exception` to `false` to prevent stack traces from being logged automatically. For database errors, use parameterized queries or JPA methods to prevent SQL injection and avoid revealing database details in error messages.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Flask</summary>

In Flask, ensure that error handling is properly configured to prevent stack traces from being sent to the client. Use Flask's errorhandler or register_error_handler to define custom error responses that do not include sensitive information. Additionally, employ logging to record stack traces internally rather than exposing them to users.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Nuxt</summary>

In Nuxt.js applications, ensure that error handling is properly implemented to avoid exposing stack traces to the client. Use try-catch blocks to catch exceptions and log them internally, while providing generic error messages to the user. Additionally, configure the production environment to disable detailed error reporting. For API responses, consider using a centralized error handling mechanism that sanitizes error messages before sending them to the client.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Fastapi</summary>

In FastAPI, ensure that error handlers are configured to catch exceptions and return generic error messages. Avoid exposing stack traces or specific error details in production environments.
