# ðŸŽ¯ Improve coverage

## Improving your application coverage:

The coverage statistic is available in the summary tab of successful scans. It measures the percentage of queries and mutations escape could perform among the full schema.

### Set scan type to read & write:

A read-only scan does not run mutations.

This will be checked if the scan is indeed in read & write mode.

The message: `In this scan, x% of operations were attempted.` will be displayed if less than 100% operations were attempted and the scan is not in read and write mode.

### Provide authentication with enough permissions:

You can provide custom authentication headers in your application configuration to allow escape to run authenticated operations.

This will be checked if the application has headers configured and no operations were unauthorized or forbidden.

The message: `In this scan. x% of operations were unauthorized or forbidden.` will be displayed if at least one operation was unauthorized/forbidden.

### Make sure the scan is not rate limited:

You can setup rate limit in your application settings [(learn more)](https://docs.escape.tech/advanced-usage/rate-limiting), though it may have an impact on the scan coverage, as operation can be rate limited.

This will be checked if no operations are rate limited.

The message: `In this scan, x% of operations were discarded because of your rate limit configuration.` will be displayed if at least one operation was rate limited.

### Avoid server errors:

Your server might return some errors during the scan that prevents Escape from performing some operations. This can be due to a bug in your application or a misconfiguration.

The message: `In this scan, x% of operations were discarded because of server errors.` will be displayed if at least one operation was rate limited.

Learn more about Internal Server Errors (`500`), Bad Gateway (`502`), Service Unavailable (`503`), Gateway Timeout (`504`), and other server errors on [Mozzila's documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

### Blacklisting operations

Please be aware that **ignoring security checks or alerts** may decrease the coverage statistics of your application, as our scanner will skip those tests.
