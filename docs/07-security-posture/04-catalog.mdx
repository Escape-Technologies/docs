# API Catalog

In today's interconnected digital landscape, the sheer number of APIs an organization uses can be overwhelming, making it increasingly difficult to keep track of your attack surface. That's where the API Catalog feature comes into play. As part of Escape's Attack Surface Management suite, API Catalog provides a centralized inventory of all your externally exposed APIs. With the API Catalog, you can gain unparalleled insights into your organization's API security posture, simply by inputting your domain name.

## Features

### Easy Inventory

- **Automated Discovery**: Just input your organization's domain name, and the API Catalog will automatically inventory all the API services exposed to the internet.
- **Schema Information**: For each discovered API, gain insights into its schemaâ€”whether it's open, leaking on the internet, or properly secured.
- **Authentication Status**: Know immediately whether an endpoint enforces authentication, helping you spot potential weak links in your security chain.
- **Security Status**: Receive real-time security assessments of each API, enabling your team to prioritize remediation actions.

### Data Export and Integration

- **CSV Export**: Easily export your API inventory and its associated data to a CSV file.
- **Third-Party Integration**: Import your CSV file into other API management tools like [Datadog API Catalog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/api_catalog/) or [Backstage.io](https://backstage.io/) for extended functionality and analysis.

## Benefits

### Enhanced Security Posture

- **Risk Mitigation**: Quickly identify and assess potentially insecure endpoints, reducing your organization's overall risk.

### Operational Efficiency
