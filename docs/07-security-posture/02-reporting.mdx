For any modern organization, visibility into its security posture is paramount. With the continuous deployment of applications and updates, it's essential to have a system that tracks, analyzes, and reports on potential security vulnerabilities. Escape's Security Reporting feature is designed precisely with this objective in mind, ensuring that your security teams are always a step ahead.

## Overview of API Security Issues Over Time

Our reporting module provides a chronological overview of detected issues, enabling your team to identify patterns, peak vulnerability periods, and measure the efficacy of remediation strategies.
- **Categorization of Risks**: Not all vulnerabilities bear the same weight. We categorize risks by their type, ensuring that high-priority threats don't get lost in the noise. This categorization enables teams to allocate resources efficiently and address critical vulnerabilities on a priority basis.
