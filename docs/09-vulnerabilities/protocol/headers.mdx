# Headers

## Description

* **Cache-Control**:
 - The HTTP 'Cache-Control' header is used to specify directives for caching mechanisms.
 - The server did not return (or returned an invalid) 'Cache-Control' header, which means pages containing sensitive information could be stored client-side and then be exposed to unauthorized persons.

 * **Content-Type**:
   - The Content-Type header was either missing or empty.

 * **X-Content-Type-Options**:
   - The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to ‘nosniff’.
   - This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

 * **Strict-Transport-Security**:
   - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that complying user agents (such as a web browser) are to interact with it using only secure HTTPS connections (i.e. HTTP layered over TLS/SSL).
   - HSTS is an IETF standard track protocol specified in RFC 6797.

 * **CookiesSecure**:
   - A cookie has been set without the secure flag, which means that the cookie can be accessed via unencrypted connections.

 * **CookiesHttpOnly**:
   - A cookie has been set without the HttpOnly flag, which means that JavaScript code can access the cookie.
   - If a malicious script runs on this page, then the cookie will be accessible and can be transmitted to another hacker-controlled site. If this is a session cookie, then session hijacking may be possible.

 * **VersionDisclosure**:
   - The web/application server is leaking server version information via one or more HTTP response headers.
   - Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other frameworks/components your web application is reliant upon, and the vulnerabilities of such components may be subject to the leaked information.


## Remediation

* **Cache-Control**:
  - Whenever possible, ensure the cache-control HTTP header is set with no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, and that the pragma HTTP header is set with no-cache.

* **Content-Type**:
  - Ensure each page sets the specific and appropriate content-type value for the delivered content.

* **X-Content-Type-Options**:
  - Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
  - If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

* **Strict-Transport-Security**:
  - Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc., are configured to enforce Strict-Transport-Security.

* **CookiesSecure**:
  - Whenever a cookie contains sensitive information or is a session token, it should always be passed using an encrypted channel.
  - Ensure that the secure flag is set for cookies containing such sensitive information

* **CookiesHttpOnly**:
  - Ensure that the HttpOnly flag is set for all cookies.

* **VersionDisclosure**:
  - Remove headers disclosing server-side softwares version.
