# SSL enforced

## Description

This security **best practice** should be enforced by your organization, at least for your API routes.

Here are 4 risk examples when allowing unsecure `HTTP`:

- **Man in the Middle attacks**: hackers can intercept and alter data from a legitimate request.
- **Misuse of data**: confidential information can be accessed by hackers.
- **Downranking of websites**: your website can be considered insecure by search engines and rated as not trustworthy.
- **Loss of customers' trust**: without a secure HTTPS padlock displayed on your website, users may rightfully consider it to be unsafe.

Using [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) is not a solution to this problem, as it won't protect against MITM attacks and regular "public wifi sniffing" until connection has been upgraded to HTTPS.
As recommended by [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/security/https), make sure that no cookies are being sent through HSTS.


## Remediation

Enforce using HTTPS (using an SSL certificate) in order to protect your users' connections.
In most cases, this must be done at ingress/(reverse-)proxy level.

- **Caddy**: [CaddyServer documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/servers/automatic_https/).
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: [Nginx documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/securing-http-traffic-upstream/).
- **Express**: [Node, Express, SSL Certificate: run HTTPS server from scratch in 5 steps](https://dev.to/omergulen/step-by-step-node-express-ssl-certificate-run-https-server-from-scratch-in-5-steps-5b87).
- **graphql-go/graphql**: [golang-tls](https://github.com/denji/golang-tls).

If you are using **Let's Encrypt** certificates, make sure to authorize HTTPS to HTTPS redirections on the path `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` to avoid any issues.
