# HeartBleed

## Description

The TLS implementation in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g does not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, potentially disclosing sensitive information.


## Remediation

To effectively prevent HeartBleed attacks:
- Update to OpenSSL 1.0.1g or later.
- Re-issue HTTPS certificates.
- Change asymmetric private keys and shared secret keys, since these may have been compromised with no evidence of corruption in the server log files.



### GraphQL Specific

<details>
    <summary>Apollo</summary>

To mitigate the Heartbleed vulnerability within the Apollo framework engine, it is essential to update the OpenSSL library to the latest patched version that addresses the CVE-2014-0160 vulnerability. Ensure that all systems using the Apollo framework are using this updated version of OpenSSL. Additionally, regenerate all security certificates and keys that may have been compromised as a result of the vulnerability, and revoke any old certificates. It is also recommended to force a password change for all users to prevent unauthorized access from potentially compromised credentials.

<details>
    <summary>Yoga</summary>

To remediate the Heartbleed vulnerability within the Yoga framework engine, it is essential to update the OpenSSL library to the latest patched version that has addressed the Heartbleed bug (CVE-2014-0160). Ensure that all systems using the Yoga framework are using this updated version of OpenSSL. Additionally, it is recommended to regenerate all security certificates as well as revoke and replace any keys that may have been compromised due to the vulnerability. After updating, thoroughly test the system to confirm that the patch has been applied successfully and that the Yoga framework engine is no longer susceptible to Heartbleed exploits.

<details>
    <summary>Awsappsync</summary>

To remediate the Heartbleed vulnerability within the AWS AppSync framework, ensure that all underlying systems and dependencies, such as EC2 instances running your resolvers or Lambda functions, are using a version of OpenSSL that is patched against CVE-2014-0160. Update the OpenSSL library to the latest secure version, and rotate any potentially compromised keys and certificates. Additionally, review your AppSync resolvers and data sources to confirm they are not exposed to the vulnerability. AWS services are regularly updated, but you should verify that you are using the latest AWS SDKs and IAM policies to enforce secure communication.

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlgo</summary>

To mitigate the Heartbleed vulnerability in a GraphQL Go framework engine, ensure that you are using the latest version of the OpenSSL library that has patched the Heartbleed bug. Update your system's OpenSSL package to the latest version provided by your operating system's package manager. Additionally, regenerate all SSL certificates after updating OpenSSL, as the private keys may have been compromised due to the vulnerability. It is also recommended to force a password change for all users as a precautionary measure.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

To mitigate the Heartbleed vulnerability within a GraphQL Ruby framework engine, ensure you are using a version of OpenSSL that is 1.0.1g or later, as these versions contain the necessary patches to address the issue. Additionally, update the graphql-ruby gem to the latest version to incorporate any security fixes. It is also recommended to regenerate all SSL certificates after updating OpenSSL, as they may have been compromised if they were created with a vulnerable version of OpenSSL.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Hasura</summary>

To mitigate the Heartbleed vulnerability within a Hasura framework engine, ensure that you are using the latest version of OpenSSL that has patched the Heartbleed bug. Update the Hasura engine to the latest version that includes the updated OpenSSL. Additionally, regenerate all the SSL certificates after updating OpenSSL to ensure that any compromised keys are no longer in use.
