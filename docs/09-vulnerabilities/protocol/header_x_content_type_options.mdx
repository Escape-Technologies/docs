# X-Content-Type-Options

## Description

The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header `X-Content-Type-Options` is missing or not set to `nosniff`.
This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.


## Remediation

Ensure that the application/web server sets the `Content-Type` header appropriately and that it sets the `X-Content-Type-Options` header to `nosniff` for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

### REST Specific

<details>
    <summary>Asp_net</summary>

In ASP.NET, configure your application to include the 'X-Content-Type-Options' header with the value 'nosniff' in all responses. This can be achieved by adding a custom HTTP header in your web.config file or by setting the header programmatically in your Global.asax.cs or in a custom HTTP module.

<details>
    <summary>Ruby_on_rails</summary>

In Ruby on Rails, set the 'X-Content-Type-Options' header to 'nosniff' in your application's configuration. You can do this by adding 'config.action_dispatch.default_headers.merge!({'X-Content-Type-Options' => 'nosniff'})' to the 'config/application.rb' file. This will apply the header to all responses from your application, instructing browsers not to MIME-sniff the content type.

<details>
    <summary>Next_js</summary>

In your Next.js application, ensure that the `X-Content-Type-Options` header is set to `nosniff` for all responses. This can be achieved by configuring your server to include this header, or by using Next.js middleware to set the header programmatically for each response.
