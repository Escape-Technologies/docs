# Partial SSRF

## Description

Partial Server-Side Request Forgery occurs when the attacker can manipulate a request made by the server.


## Remediation

Basic blacklisting and regular expressions are a bad approach to mitigating SSRF.

The correct ways to prevent SSRF are:
- Whitelisting and DNS resolution: whitelist the hostname (DNS name) or IP address that your application needs to access. (Best method to prevent SSRF))
- Response handling: To prevent response data from leaking to the attacker, you must ensure that the received response is as expected. Under no circumstances should the raw response body from the request sent by the server be delivered to the client.
- Disabling unused URL schemas: if your application only uses HTTP or HTTPS to make requests, allow only these URL schemas. Once unused URL schemas are disabled, the attacker will be unable to exploit the web application to make requests using potentially dangerous schemas such as `file:///`, `dict://`, `ftp://`, and `gopher://`.
- Authentication on internal services.



### GraphQL Specific

<details>
    <summary>Apollo</summary>

To prevent SSRF in Apollo, validate and sanitize all user inputs, restrict the URLs the server can request, and use a denylist of internal resources that should not be accessible.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Yoga</summary>

In Yoga, mitigate SSRF by sanitizing user inputs, enforcing URL allowlists, and avoiding the exposure of sensitive internal systems.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Awsappsync</summary>

For AWS AppSync, use VTL resolvers to validate input URLs, employ AWS WAF to filter malicious requests, and configure IAM policies to limit the scope of accessible resources.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlgo</summary>

In GraphQL Go, prevent SSRF by validating URLs against a strict pattern, using an allowlist for allowed domains, and by implementing proper error handling to avoid leaking information about the internal network.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

For GraphQL Ruby, ensure that user-provided URLs are validated against a strict pattern or allowlist, and consider using a proxy server to control outbound requests from the server.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Hasura</summary>

In Hasura, protect against SSRF by validating all external URLs, using environment variables for internal endpoints, and restricting outbound requests with webhook configurations.

</details>


### REST Specific

<details>
    <summary>Asp.net</summary>

To prevent SSRF in ASP.NET, validate all URLs and hostname resolutions, use an allowlist for allowed endpoints, and implement network segmentation to protect internal services.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Ruby on rails</summary>

In Ruby on Rails, mitigate SSRF by sanitizing user input, using allowlists for safe URLs, and employing Ruby's built-in URI library to parse and validate URLs before use.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Next.js</summary>

For Next.js applications, prevent SSRF by validating URLs on the server-side, using a strict allowlist for outbound requests, and avoiding the exposure of sensitive server-side endpoints to the client.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Laravel</summary>

In Laravel, protect against SSRF by using validation rules for URLs, employing the Guzzle HTTP client with safe defaults, and restricting access to internal network resources.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Express.js</summary>

To prevent SSRF in Express.js, validate and sanitize input URLs, use a middleware to enforce URL allowlists, and isolate internal services from the public network.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Django</summary>

In Django, prevent SSRF by using the built-in validators for URL fields, applying network segmentation, and ensuring that any use of the requests library is done with caution and validation.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Symfony</summary>

For Symfony applications, use the Symfony HttpClient component with caution, validate all external URLs, and configure firewall rules to restrict access to internal services.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Spring boot</summary>

In Spring Boot, protect against SSRF by validating URLs with Java's URI class, using allowlists for allowed hosts, and configuring security settings to limit access to internal services.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Flask</summary>

To prevent SSRF in Flask, validate URLs using Werkzeug's URL parsing utilities, employ an allowlist for outbound requests, and use Flask-Talisman for setting HTTP security headers.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Nuxt</summary>

In Nuxt.js, mitigate SSRF risks by validating and sanitizing all user inputs, using server-side environment variables for internal URLs, and configuring server middleware for URL allowlisting.
