# Server Side Request Forgery

## Description

SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL.
It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL).


## Remediation

Basic blacklisting and regular expressions are a bad approach to mitigating SSRF.

The correct ways to prevent SSRF are:
- Whitelisting and DNS resolution: whitelist the hostname (DNS name) or IP address that your application needs to access. (Best method to prevent SSRF))
- Response handling: To prevent response data from leaking to the attacker, you must ensure that the received response is as expected. Under no circumstances should the raw response body from the request sent by the server be delivered to the client.
- Disabling unused URL schemas: if your application only uses HTTP or HTTPS to make requests, allow only these URL schemas. Once unused URL schemas are disabled, the attacker will be unable to exploit the web application to make requests using potentially dangerous schemas such as `file:///`, `dict://`, `ftp://`, and `gopher://`.
- Authentication on internal services.



### GraphQL Specific

<details>
    <summary>Apollo</summary>

To mitigate Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the Apollo framework engine, ensure that any user-supplied URLs are validated against a strict whitelist of allowed domains and protocols. Implement proper input validation and sanitization to reject malicious or unexpected input. Additionally, consider using a server-side proxy with an allowlist to restrict outbound traffic to trusted destinations only. Employ least privilege principles by restricting the server's network access, and regularly audit and monitor outgoing requests to detect and respond to any SSRF attempts.

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlgo</summary>

To mitigate Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in a GraphQL Go framework engine, validate and sanitize all user-supplied URLs and inputs. Implement strict allowlists for external services that can be accessed, and use a dedicated HTTP client with limited permissions. Additionally, consider employing network-level controls to restrict outbound traffic to trusted endpoints only.

<details>
    <summary>Graphqlruby</summary>

To mitigate Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in a GraphQL Ruby framework, ensure that any user-supplied URLs or input used in network requests are validated against a whitelist of allowed domains and protocols. Additionally, employ least privilege by restricting the server's network access to only necessary external services, and consider using a dedicated library or service for fetching URLs that has built-in SSRF protection. Regularly review and update the whitelist and security policies to adapt to new threats.

<details>
    <summary>Hasura</summary>

To mitigate Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Hasura, ensure that any user-supplied URLs for webhooks or remote schemas are validated against a whitelist of allowed domains and protocols. Additionally, employ network policies to restrict the Hasura engine's outbound traffic to known safe destinations, and consider using a server-side proxy to handle external requests, which can provide an additional layer of filtering and access control.

### REST Specific

<details>
    <summary>Asp_net</summary>

To mitigate SSRF vulnerabilities in ASP.NET applications, validate all user-supplied URLs to ensure they point to allowed destinations. Implement a whitelist of approved services and reject any requests not matching the criteria. Additionally, use built-in .NET classes such as 'HttpClient' with proper URL validation, and avoid concatenating user input in URLs. Employ least privilege principles by restricting the server's ability to make outbound requests to only necessary services and ports.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Ruby_on_rails</summary>

In Ruby on Rails, mitigate SSRF by validating and sanitizing user input, ensuring URLs are from an allowed list of hosts and schemes. Employ the 'uri' standard library to parse and validate URLs, and consider using a dedicated gem like 'ssrf_filter' for enhanced protection. Additionally, apply network-level controls to restrict outbound traffic to trusted destinations.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Next_js</summary>

In Next.js applications, mitigate SSRF by validating and sanitizing all user inputs, implementing strict URL allowlists, and using built-in server-side functions like `fetch` with caution. Ensure that any URLs constructed from user inputs are checked against a predetermined list of allowed destinations. Additionally, consider using network-level controls to restrict the server's ability to initiate requests to untrusted hosts.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Laravel</summary>

In Laravel, mitigate SSRF by validating and sanitizing all user inputs, especially URL parameters. Use Laravel's built-in validation rules, such as 'url' or custom regex patterns, to ensure only allowed URLs are processed. Additionally, restrict outgoing requests to a predefined list of trusted domains and employ the 'GuzzleHttp' client with caution, setting appropriate timeouts and redirect limits.

<details>
    <summary>Express_js</summary>

To mitigate SSRF vulnerabilities in an Express.js application, ensure that all user-supplied URLs are validated against a whitelist of allowed domains and paths.
