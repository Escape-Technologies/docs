# Sensitive endpoint bruteforce

## Description

During our security assessment, we identified a vulnerability in the rate-limiting mechanism of a public mutation endpoint. Multiple requests to this endpoint were made without triggering any rate-limiting defenses. This lack of rate limitation exposes the endpoint to brute force attacks, where an attacker could try numerous combinations of credentials or inputs to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services. Such vulnerabilities are critical, especially if the endpoint handles sensitive data or critical functions.


## Remediation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is crucial to implement an effective rate limiting mechanism on the mutation endpoint. This should include limiting the number of requests a user can make within a given time frame, and escalating restrictions for repeated violations. Consider using tools like Redis for efficient rate limiting. Additionally, implement alert mechanisms for unusual traffic patterns or repeated failed attempts, which can be early indicators of a brute force attack.
