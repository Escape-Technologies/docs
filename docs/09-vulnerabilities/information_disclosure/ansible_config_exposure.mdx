# Ansible Config Exposure

## Description

Detects publicly accessible Ansible configuration files.

## Remediation

To remediate an Ansible configuration exposure, follow these steps:

1. Identify and secure exposed Ansible configuration files (e.g., `ansible.cfg`) by setting proper file permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 ansible.cfg`).
2. Rotate any credentials or secrets that may have been compromised due to the exposure.
3. Use Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive variables and files, or store secrets in a secure secrets management tool.
4. Review and update `.gitignore` or equivalent in your version control system to prevent accidental commits of sensitive files.
5. Implement access controls and audit logs to monitor access to Ansible configurations and sensitive data.
6. Regularly review and audit your Ansible playbooks and roles for hard-coded sensitive data and remove them.
7. Conduct security training for team members to prevent future misconfigurations or exposures.
8. If using a public repository, consider changing its status to private or ensure no sensitive data is pushed to it.
