# Exposed settings.php

## Description

Detects backup files of settings.php that may disclose sensitive information.

## Remediation

To remediate an exposed settings.php file:

1. Change file permissions to restrict public access. Set the file to be readable only by the server process (e.g., chmod 400 settings.php).
2. Move sensitive information to a non-web-accessible location or environment variables if possible.
3. Ensure the settings.php file is not included in any public repositories or backups.
4. Implement access controls and firewall rules to limit access to the file.
5. Regularly audit file permissions and access controls to ensure they remain secure.
6. Update the .htaccess file to deny direct access to settings.php.
7. Use security modules/plugins provided by the CMS to enhance file security.
8. Regularly update the CMS and all associated plugins/modules to their latest secure versions.
