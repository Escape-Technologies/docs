# Forced Browsing

## Description

Forced browsing occurs when an attacker is able to access parts of a web application that are not intended to be accessible. This can happen due to missing or incorrect authorization checks on certain resources or functionalities.
Example: An attacker accesses a restricted admin page by directly entering the URL (e.g., `http://example.com/admin`) without proper authorization.


## Remediation

To prevent forced browsing vulnerabilities, take the following actions:
- Implement strict authorization checks for all resources and functionalities, ensuring that only authorized users can access restricted areas.
- Use security frameworks and libraries that enforce access control policies.
- Regularly audit and test your application for unauthorized access points.
- Ensure proper configuration of access control mechanisms in your web server and application code.



### REST Specific

<details>
    <summary>Asp_net</summary>

Ensure that all routes in the ASP.NET application are properly protected by implementing and enforcing authorization checks. Use the [Authorize] attribute on controllers and actions to restrict access to authenticated users.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Ruby_on_rails</summary>

In Ruby on Rails, use before_action callbacks in your controllers to verify that the current user is authorized to access the route. Implement robust authorization frameworks like Pundit or CanCanCan.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Next_js</summary>

Implement middleware in Next.js to verify user credentials or tokens before processing requests. Ensure consistent application of these checks across all endpoints.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Laravel</summary>

Use Laravel's built-in middleware to enforce authentication and authorization. Apply the 'auth' middleware to routes that need protection, and use Laravel's gate features for fine-grained access control.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Express_js</summary>

Protect routes in Express.js using middleware like Passport.js or express-jwt. Ensure that user credentials and permissions are verified before processing requests.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Django</summary>

Use Django's built-in decorators such as @login_required for function-based views or LoginRequiredMixin for class-based views. Ensure that all routes correctly check user permissions.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Symfony</summary>

Implement access controls in Symfony using the 'security.yaml' configuration file. Use voters or access decision managers to check user permissions before granting access to sensitive routes.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Spring_boot</summary>

Use Spring Security to authenticate and authorize requests in Spring Boot applications. Protect controller methods with annotations like @PreAuthorize to enforce role-based access control.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Flask</summary>

Protect Flask routes by using decorators like @login_required. Ensure user authentication and authorization before allowing access to state-altering operations.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Nuxt</summary>

Implement middleware in Nuxt.js to verify user credentials before granting access to sensitive data or actions. Regularly review and update route permissions.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Fastapi</summary>

Secure FastAPI routes by integrating security dependencies such as OAuth2 with JWT tokens. Apply these dependencies to route operations to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain functionalities.
