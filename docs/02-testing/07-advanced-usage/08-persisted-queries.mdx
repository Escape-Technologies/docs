## Overview

Persisted queries are a mechanism to improve the performance and security of GraphQL APIs.
By storing (or persisting) the queries on the server, clients can refer to these queries using a unique identifier instead of sending the entire query string.
This reduces the payload size, minimizes parsing overhead, and helps prevent certain types of attacks, such as query injection.

If persisted queries are enabled on your server, Escape is enable to scan your API by default as it doesn't know the persited queries hashs.
You need to configure your application to allow Escape to scan it.

## Configuring the application

As this feature is actually in beta, the configuration is only available on the `Expert` tab of your application.

Go to your application page, then go to `Settings` (top right corner) and click on the `Expert` tab (on the left).
