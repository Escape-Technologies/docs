# AWS Cognito Authentication with Escape

## Description
The &#39;Cognito User Password&#39; preset is designed for authentication using AWS Cognito with username and password credentials:

- **AWS Cognito Integration**: Leverages AWS Cognito, a comprehensive user identity and data synchronization service, for authentication.
- **Regional Configuration**: Allows specifying the AWS region where the Cognito service is hosted, ensuring proper routing and compliance with data residency requirements.
- **Client Credentials**: Utilizes a client ID and client secret for secure OAuth requests within the Cognito framework.
- **User Authentication**: Facilitates the creation and authentication of users with a username and password.

This preset is ideal for systems that use AWS Cognito for managing user authentication, providing a seamless integration with the AWS ecosystem.

## Examples

```yaml
preset:
-   type: cognito_userpass
    client_id: yourCognitoClientId
    client_secret: yourCognitoClientSecret

        scopes:

        - delete
    -   username: user2
