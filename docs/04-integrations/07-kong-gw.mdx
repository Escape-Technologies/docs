# ü¶ç Kong Gateway

By integrating your Kong Gateway with Escape, you can further enrich your inventory and discover more endpoints and more API specifications easily.


## Instructions

Go to your Kong Admin UI (usually running on port 8002) and go to the Plugins sections `/plugins/key-auth/create?redirect=/plugins`

The official `key-auth` plugin documentation is available on [the Official Kong Documentation](https://app.escape.tech/integrations/kong-gateway/#:~:text=Official%20Kong%20Documentation)

Do not change the default `key_names` apikey

Then, list our your available consumers or add one `:8001/consumers/`, then copy the id of the consumer.

Lastly, create the key for the consumer `curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/consumers/$CONSUMER_ID/key-auth` and copy the key from the JSON response.

Paste the API key and the Admin API URL into Escape

You're done! Your integration should sync right away.
