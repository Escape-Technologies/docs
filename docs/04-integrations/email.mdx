# ðŸ“¨ Email notifications

By default, Escape sends notifications of new vulnerabilities directly into your mailbox! 

Head to the [integrations page](https://app.escape.tech/integrations/) to customize your email notifications. 

These settings are bound to your account. You can configure them freely without any impact on your team.
