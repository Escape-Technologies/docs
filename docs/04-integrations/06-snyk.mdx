# üêï Snyk SAST

Snyk and Escape provide developers with the ability to secure their GraphQL applications during the development lifecycle through an end-to-end AppSec approach that includes Snyk SAST and Escape DAST.

By linking your Escape organization with A Snyk organization, you can enrich our alerts with potentially responsible source code identified in Snyk code.

To configure a new Snyk integration, you can head to the [Snyk integration page](https://app.escape.tech/integrations/snyk) and enter your Snyk `API key` and your Snyk `organization ID`.

Once this configuration is done, you will be able to link Escape applications with Snyk projects from the `advanced` configuration tab of your application.

After an application and a project are linked, we will automatically bind alerts from Escape with potential causes identified in [Snyk code](https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/).
