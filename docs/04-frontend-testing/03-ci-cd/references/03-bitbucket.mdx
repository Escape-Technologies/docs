import RequiredTag from "@site/src/components/RequiredTag";
import TypeTag from "@site/src/components/TypeTag";

## Basic example

```yaml
image: node:alpine

pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: Deploy
        script:
          # Your deployment scripts here

    - step:
        name: Escape
        trigger: manual  # Set to manual if you wish to run this step manually
        after-script:   # Similar to post-deploy in GitLab
          - npm install -g @escape.tech/action
          - npm show @escape.tech/action version
          - escape-action
        deployment: staging  # Assuming staging environment for deployment
        script:
          - echo "Starting Escape scan..."
        services:
          - docker
        caches:
          - node
        size: 2x
        max-time: 10
        variables:
          ESCAPE_APPLICATION_ID: $ESCAPE_APPLICATION_ID
          ESCAPE_API_KEY: $ESCAPE_API_KEY
```

## Failure behavior

By default, Escape cli will fail if any High issues are flagged, and will exit with an error code 1.

## Available variables

### `ESCAPE_APPLICATION_ID` <TypeTag type="string"/> <RequiredTag/>

The id of the application on Escape that will be scanned continuously.  
You can find it in your [Escape application settings](https://app.escape.tech).

### `ESCAPE_API_KEY` <TypeTag type="string"/> <RequiredTag/>

Your API key on the Escape platform.  
You can find it in your [Escape settings](https://app.escape.tech/user/profile/).

### `SCHEMA_URL` <TypeTag type="string"/>

The URL to your API schema, that you want to upload to the specific application `ESCAPE_APPLICATION_ID`

### `SCHEMA_FILE` <TypeTag type="string"/>

The filepath to your API schema, that you want to upload to the specific application `ESCAPE_APPLICATION_ID`

### `FAIL_ON_SEVERITIES` <TypeTag type="string"/>

A csv-delimited string that should contain either of these severities to define a failure of the cli (exit code 1):

- HIGH
- MEDIUM
- LOW
- INFO

For example, `export FAIL_ON_SEVERITIES=HIGH,MEDIUM` will make the cli fail if any HIGH or MEDIUM issues are flagged.

### `TIMEOUT` <TypeTag type="number"/>

The timeout of the job. If set to 0, the scan will be started, but the job will not wait for it to be finished before terminating.

The triggered scan will run asynchronously on Escape, and your team will be notified once it is done using your desired [notifications](/platform/workflows) settings.
