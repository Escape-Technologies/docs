2. Select Frontend (alpha)
2. Enter your application's deployment URL and click on `Validate`
3. Select a name for the application, and select if you want the scan to run in development (read-write mode) or production (read-only) environment.
5. You are all set!

## Common pitfalls

### My application requires authentication

You can of course configure a header to be sent with the requests, in order to authenticate your application. 

This can be done after creating the scan, by visiting the Settings page of your scan, and configuring headers like any other API scan.

You can read about this in the [Headers](/api-testing/authentication/presets/headers) section.
