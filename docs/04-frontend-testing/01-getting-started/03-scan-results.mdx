# ðŸ“Š Interpret results

Once the scan is over, you are automatically redirected to the scan results page, where you can easily find the following:

- Common vulnerabilities or issues and their remediations
- Secret leaks
- Performance issues
- Exports (PDF, Postman)

You can also configure the application from this page or start a new scan to verify if vulnerabilities are fixed correctly.


The main pages for Frontend scans are:
- Issues
- Visited Pages


## Issues

This page lists all the issues found during the scan, with a brief description and a link to the remediation page.
It is very similar to the API scan issues page, but with a focus on frontend vulnerabilities.


You also can open a sidepanel to view more information regarding each issue.
We include a link to the Trace Viewer which will show you the exact steps that led to the issue being found.

The trace format is based on a Playwright trace, which includes screenshots and elements crawled during the scan so you can debug in depth.

## Visited Pages

The Visited Pages is also an important part of your scan results.
Contrary to API Scans, the scanner does not have a predefined list of endpoints, so it's scanning is based on a crawling system, and a security checks engine.
This way you can validate the pages that were visited and the issues found on each page.
