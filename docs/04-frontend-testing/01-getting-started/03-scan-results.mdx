Once the scan is over, you are automatically redirected to the scan results page, where you can easily find the following:

- Common vulnerabilities and their remediations
- Secret leaks
- Performance issues
- Exports (PDF, Postman)

You can also configure the application from this page or start a new scan to verify if vulnerabilities are fixed correctly.
