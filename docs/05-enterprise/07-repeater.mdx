Escape's Repeater Agent allows you to scan scan Internal Apps behind your organization's firewall or VPN.

This repeater creates a private tunnel between Escape and one of your servers.
All the escape requests will comes from this server.

Here is a schema of the infrastructure :

![Escape repeater](./img/repeater.drawio.svg)

First, the repeater client you have deployed locally will connect to the repeater manager (1).
When you start a scan on escape, instead of sending the requests directly to your server, Escape will send them to the repeater manager (2).
Your client will receive the requests and send them to your server (3 & 4).
The results are sent back to Escape to allow you to see scans results.
