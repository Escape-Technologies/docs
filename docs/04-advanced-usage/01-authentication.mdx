# 🔐 Custom Authentication

Escape supports most authentication methods, using the open-source package `PyMultiAuth`.

The authentification is defined by two keys in the advanced configuration: `users` and `auth`. 
To use those keys properly, please go to **MultiAuth** [documentation](https://escape-technologies.github.io/py-multiauth/).
